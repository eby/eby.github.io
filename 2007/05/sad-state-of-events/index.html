For example author talks or signings. You could probably extend it to subjects if you have a lot of workshops. If you have pictures or video of an author talk, why not link or embed it in the catalog page (while trying not to make the view too busy). Of course you can link to holdings on the event page as well.\nAnd since we’re on multimedia it would be nice if more talks were digitized (rights permitted of course) and available online. You not only let those who couldn’t make it see it, you also show what kind of services your library is providing that people might not be aware of.\nOverall I think there is plenty of room for improvement and events might be an overlooked area with all of the talk on the catalog.
