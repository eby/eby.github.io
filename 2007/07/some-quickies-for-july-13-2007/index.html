<p>A short article on a study on how many terms users added versus the controlled vocabulary chosen for pieces of art. The discussion centers around the findability of items where 70% of the terms people use are not present. Usually the debate in libraries revolves around the noise or organization issue and seems to ignore the findability. Controlled vocabularies will always have their place, especially in inventory control. But for search and finding aids, folksonomy may play an important role.</p>
