In addition to the \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; summer reading game, players can earn points for writing reviews, adding comments and finding game codes at events and locations. Players also earn badges for special accomplishments. We just passed player ID #4000 and we still have weeks to go for even more players to join and earn points and prizes. The pieces that make up the Summer Game are diverse but by adding custom code to the solid foundations provided by these open tools we\u0026rsquo;ve been able to concentrate our efforts on adding new content and functionality rather than chasing bugs and putting out fires. Here\u0026rsquo;s some of the tools and technologies that make up the Summer Game:\nDrupal: The aadl.org websites run on the Drupal Content Management System. In addition to giving us a framework for writing blogs, creating user accounts and writing comments, it has a extensive API which allows us to leverage those pieces to add our own functionality. A drupal module for Summer Game was created that keeps track of player data, lets players add points through multiple activities, and displays a leaderboard. Players are attached to user accounts, and a simple function which could be placed in any code that runs the site allows us to award points for any website action. The summer game module is available through github: Summer Game module.\nUbercart: The Summer Game shop runs on this Drupal module that provides a simple shop interface for your Drupal site. Again, it has a extensive API which allowed us to use Summer Game points as a custom payment type. We also added a hook into the order process to send data to our custom label printing function, printing labels for the items at the time of order, and creating custom order emails. By leveraging the ubercart module, we were able to create a complete online shop and order fulfillment process in about 3 weeks, start to finish.\nFPDF/FPDI: The core of the Summer Game is still the \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; summer reading game, where you read books, fill out a score card, bring it to a library location and get a prize. This year we decided to track all our score cards with unique identifier numbers to see where and when people picked them up. We also wanted to allow players to print their score cards on demand as PDF files. The FPDF library allows us to dynamically create each score card PDF with a unique number. We also use the FPDF library to create easily-printable Game Code signs so staff can post a points-accruing Game Code at their events. The FPDI plugin for FPDF allows you to import an existing PDF as a template for your FPDF document.\nRedis: Redis provides a persistent data store, similar to a database, but as key-value pairs rather than tables. We used Redis to store the score card identification numbers because it allowed us to do an atomic increment operation. We don\u0026rsquo;t want two people printing score cards at the same time with the same ID number. In a single call we can get the next number in the sequence without worrying about holding other people up or both grabbing the same number. We also use Redis to store our shop email notification data in a processing queue which allows us to delay sending them out. We currently use the Redisent PHP library to talk to our Redis install.\nTwilio: Twilio provides an easy API to interact with users via cell phone text messages. By creating a simple drupal module that utilizes the Twilio API we allowed players at an event to easily sign up for the game and start earning points using their cell phones. We also use twilio to send prize pickup reminder text messages when we fill orders from the Summer Game shop.\nAADL is happy to share source code. View the rest of our shared code on our github page. Code monkeys not included.

Below is an overview of what I ended up doing to solve it. There are probably better ways of doing it and if so please share.\nThe Sphinx I\u0026rsquo;m referring to is the indexing/search programthat works well with MySQL. The case below is using the stock searchd/indexer interface and not the mysql engine which is probably different.\nYou can convert tables and all the fields within the table with the command (from pythoneer):\nALTER TABLE tbl_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci; You could also do utf8_general_ci. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up online is that the unicode_ci supports expansions/ligatures while the general doesn\u0026rsquo;t which can affect sorting. However, the docs say the the tradeoff is speedin some operations. Both lack some character support versus the actual Unicode Collation Algorithm.\nYou will want to set your index definition to have:\ncharset_type = utf-8 While the docs mostly just mention that I highly recommend adding the following to your source definition:\nsql_query_pre = SET CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=utf8 sql_query_pre = SET NAMES utf8 While you might think that having your tables in utf8 collation, mysql set to default to it and php encoding in utf8 would be enough, if the client doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify that it is doing utf8 mysql will store it in whatever encoding it thinks it is getting. I battled with php configs to try to ensure all machines modifying the tables were talking the same but you\u0026rsquo;ll save yourself the trouble by defining this here and also in your scripts that write to the tables.\nAs stated above I\u0026rsquo;d recommend doing a SET NAMES utf8 in front of your queries inserting data into mysql. This again may be poor setup on my part but it helps rule out different client configurations and probably makes it more portable. I found Gentoo by default seems to do fine, Debian hit or miss. Adding the SET made it work where ever I tried.\nSome documentation stated I should wipe database if it previously had other encodings. I found this unnecessary and just inserted the data with UPDATE or REPLACE INTO and had no issues.\nWhile stop words and similar allow you to use external files for the list, it appears character folding needs the list to be in the config itself. At least I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to get an include file to work. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested in knowing otherwise. Depending on the languages you have you may want to generate a list of the codes present in your dataset. Otherwise you can find some tables to try out here:\nSome reported that Sphinx can have issues with long lines in the config so you may need to break up the lines with \\ characters. Your list should also include \u0026ldquo;0..9, a..z, A..Z-\u0026gt;a..z\u0026rdquo; in it as you are overriding the default list.\nAnother thing to note with Sphinx is that many changes to the sphinx.conf requires a restart of searchd. With the modification of the folding table you\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to do this. Restart searchd and then do your indexer run for your indexes.\nTry out some searches with keywords/characters and watch the query log. If the character folding is working then you should see the encoded characters in the query log. If they are missing or replaced by spaces then the characters aren\u0026rsquo;t matching up with your folding table. Try to find the character, add it to your list, restart searchd and reindex. Sphinx defaults to not accepting characters that are not in the charset_table list. The query log is the easiest point to diagnose this at.\nThe last step is of course to make sure your web pages are served in a proper encoding so browsers render it properly.\nAgain this isn\u0026rsquo;t in depth but hopefully will help those messing with Sphinx.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2009/11/unicode-and-sphinx/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert with unicode and ran into various problems in getting Sphinx up and running with bib data for SOPAC2.

It consists of a mix of linux hosted web management software, linux thin clients and windows terminal servers. It is a bit of a unique setup so figure I should share. Once we get it farther towards complete we\u0026rsquo;ll probably release the code.\nFor some background the previous setup consisted of windows thinclients and windows servers running Citrix. The thin clients had published application sets that connected to a fairly basic server farm. The farm wasn\u0026rsquo;t really setup well resulting in high loads and slow logins. A custom set of flash applications and php gateways administered it all.\nAs I researched options I decided I wanted to drop Citrix as I didn\u0026rsquo;t really see it as needed and the licensing costs aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly small. I also decided I would prefer as much be opensource as possible though we decided on keeping Windows for the public facing part for now.\nI tested out quite a few public computing management software, lockdown software, cyber cafe software but didn\u0026rsquo;t really find anything that did everything I wanted, kept it fairly simple, was flexible, etc. For reference here are a few things about our setup:\n Patrons can use the computer as long as they want without interruption unless there are other patrons waiting for a computer. They have a minimum 30 minutes if there is a line, after which they are given 5, 2, 1 minute warnings. They can be idle for a total of 10 minutes before being ended (given a warning after 5) They swipe their card at an assigner first that gives them a station. These are spaced out then random  The thin clients we settled on are HP Compaq t5735 Thin Clients. In bulk they ran under $250 each. The specs worked out for what we needed:\n VESA mountable on both sides. Made it easy to securely mount to tables and even to the back of monitors 1 GB Flash, 256M RAM VGA and DVI Lots of USB ports including back, front and secure (within case) Debian Linux preinstalled (stock plus some custom HP packages)  The thing I like most about the thin clients is the imaging process. The clients come with a HP programs called HPThinState which can write a bootable imager to a USB drive. Once the USB is imaged you can boot other machines from the USB and walk through a simple imaging process. The process is simple enough that front line staff now image machines themselves when needed (usually ext3 partition corruption after power failure). This has significantly cut time of IT staff and reduced how long a client is out of order for simple problems.\nAnother nice thing is that all changes are put on flash immediately, no special write/flashing software needed. You can apt-get upgrade and have the changes there on reboot with no further interaction.\nOne of the biggest problems we had previously was USB ports being damaged on clients. We tried multiple things like hubs, etc but nothing really lasted. Our latest attempt is using a modular box that is meant to be inserted in a 5.25 cd bay on a tower. We put 2 usb extenders and a headphone jack extender in it and mount it to the table. This leaves an easily replaceable port and also lets us move the thin client out of harms way. So far this has worked great and we haven\u0026rsquo;t had to replace a port yet. At about $10-12 it can\u0026rsquo;t be beat.\nWe have USB floppy drives available for use and may expand to other formats. The monitors are stock though we add on privacy screens. Each station is also equipped with a USB based barcode reader that is used for signin purposes.\nWe also have one of the thin clients VESA mounted to a monitor and barcode reader that acts as the assigner.\nMore information on the actual software / workflow behind it coming up in a second post. Overall though we\u0026rsquo;ve been really happy with the hardware described above. Really stable and much better priced.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2009/06/public-computing-with-windows-servers-and-linux-thin-clients-hardware/","summary":"(also posted on the AADL devblog)\nWe recently overhauled the public computing setup at AADL, though it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been rolled out at all the branches yet.

Flying Dogis on twitter but i see quite a few business possibilities. Slow hour at the pub? Twitter a special on beers for the next 20 minutes (presuming you have foot traffic).\nQuite a few libraries also got on twitter. David Lee King has at least a partial list. Most have gone the route of using rss2twitter or similar to send out additions to their sites, etc. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really see the major benefit of that so I\u0026rsquo;ve stayed away from it. I do see the benefit of doing some announcements on it, especially since the audience may be the kind that want\u0026rsquo;s to try out beta quality apps or are technology friendly.\nThe big use I see are for events. Since we\u0026rsquo;ve recently rehauled our event backend I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try hooking it into Twitter. Since there is a PHP classavailable for the api, it became really quick and easy to try things out. Now 30 minutes before each event a tweet is sent out as a reminder. I\u0026rsquo;ve also sent out a few manual tweets asking for feedback on some quick iCal feeds and alerts of some videos added to the site (also built on the new events system). You can follow at twitter.com/aadlif you think you would get benefit from it. The route will likely be towards a SMS/IM bot type of application.\nHere are some of the other ideas I\u0026rsquo;ve had, some more feasible than others. Edhas also been helpful with trying things out and giving some feedback.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s quite a few possibilities for mobile/time/location dependent services a library provides that show potential.

I stopped using Yahoo products long ago, but started up again once they bought ones I used like Upcomingand Flickr.\nAnother Yahoo product I\u0026rsquo;ve looked into is Zimbra, a partially open-source collaboration suite which has taken off in recent years. It offers a replacement to Microsoft Exchange with the ability of Outlook and iSync to seamlessly use the calendaring, etc (with installed commercial addon). With quite a few businesses and universities using Zimbra, it looked like a promising product.\nObviously the buyout by Microsoft could mean the death of the commercial version. The interesting discussion was regarding whether the open source part of the product could be forked under the licenses the part is under. The debate regarding GPL versus everything else turned into almost mouth foaming. Still, it was interesting to see the concerns various people had when it seems like many fear open source projects that don\u0026rsquo;t have a commercial version/option. Many are calling for the commercial code to be put into a escrow that will be released under GPL if the commercial support for the product is pulled or the company bought out. Others hope yahoo spins it off or sells it prior to a takeover. Most didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to like the alternative of Scalix. You can see some of the debates here:\nMost of the library open-source ILS projects don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in this area. They tend to sell support or custom implementations. The problem seems to occur when the companies start selling the more important features or features that set them apart as commercial. Email? Sure. Exchange replacement? Extra. I don\u0026rsquo;t see LibLimeor Equinoxgoing the route of building pieces that libraries request as only commercial. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve heard LibLime requires all custom work for libraries to be GPL\u0026rsquo;d. I could potentially see other vendors like Innovative, SirsiDynixor OCLCreleasing part of a product under GPL while keeping the parts libraries actually want closed source. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s a model you want probably depends on what your looking for, but the yahoo debate should show that you may need to look closely on what they really mean by \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2008/02/open-source-with-commercial-parts/","summary":"Almost everyone has probably read about Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s bid for Yahoo.

Giving people control over it may be more difficult (I want to review things but not included in recommendations, etc.)\nThis is probably one of the first things I look for. I\u0026rsquo;ve put effort into too many new sites without any way of getting my information out in a usable way. One of the main things I worry about with the move to some \u0026ldquo;social catalogs\u0026rdquo; is that patrons will have a difficult time getting the information they put in, out. Can they export their reviews and ratings? Can they build applications on top of their data or even do the basic blog widget? Even a feed with decent data would be helpful for some sites. IMDb and Netflix could use some help in that department.\nThe ability to remove information, permanently, should be offered. If you offer to keep patron history then patrons should have the ability to remove everything, or specific items. I think this is especially important in the age of the patriot act. Patrons may want the benefits of recommendations, reading lists, etc but want to remove specific items for privacy reasons. If your going to offer opt-in services then opt-out should allow the ability to completely opt-out including removing old data.\nWith libraries being privacy-centric, the ability to opt-out (or most likely not being automatically set as opt-in) should probably be a no-brainer.\nAs I touched on earlier, if you are building services on top of the data then there should be easily read information on how the information is being used. This is a good idea in that you also let people know the benefits of opting-in and may have a higher rate of people using the feature. Recording checkout history may look more appealing once they know the various services that use the information. Having the drawbacks listed would also be nice. I personally think any data recording checkbox in libraries should probably be accompanied by a snippet/warning about the patriot act.\nListed as the ability to sell your own data, this is probably easily summed up as not taking ownership of your patrons information. Leave the ownership with them, granting yourself rights to use the data with their permission.\nProbably another more difficult (more time and effort) one to implement. Depending on the system there\u0026rsquo;s probably quite a few things you could do. Allowing only certain others to see your reviews, private/public tagging, etc. Something to keep in mind when thinking about the system. I believe there was quite a bit of debate around del.icio.us finally enabling private bookmarks and the for: tags. There\u0026rsquo;s trade-offs involved.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2007/05/data-bill-of-rights/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned Wesabe\u0026rsquo;s Data Bill of Rightsbefore.

Unfortunately I\u0026rsquo;ve been rather disappointed by the way events are presented on most library sites. Some don\u0026rsquo;t even feature or list them on the homepage which is a shame. There are some other things I think would be nice or just possibilities.\nMany are starting to use blog software so have RSS but few have iCal. MSU Librariesrecently migrated to using the campus event calendar which adds those features. If your university has an events calendar you might see if you can create a sub-calender for your events. If you use Wordpress I believe there are a few pluginsthat allow you to assign posts to a specific date and will create iCal feeds for you.\nWhile your adding iCal support you might as well add hCalendar.\nLinks to Google Calendar shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hard, but I think it would be nice to go the extra step of using things like the Upcoming API(one example) to post event information on external sites like upcoming.org. You could potentially use upcoming.org as your events manager and then use the iCal files or API to put the events on your site. Another bonus is it\u0026rsquo;s integration with Flickr using machine tags. If you store the upcoming ID locally you could probably pull in the images to your events site using the Flickr API. Flickr and Upcoming are just two examples, there are quite a few event sites out there.\nWhile I never really got into using Twitter(probably because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really interested in what others were doing), I think it might have potential here. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you already know but the description for twitter is:\nWhile some libraries are posting their RSS to twitter I think it probably makes more sense to post events and post soon before they happen. So say 15-20 minutes before an event starts you have a message sent to twitter saying its about to start and maybe another saying its starting. If I\u0026rsquo;m walking around town, get an SMS that something is starting, I can think about stopping in. Seems semi-more useful then just posting random news.\nWhile probably not as easy as the above, it would be nice to see more events featured on catalog pages if they are related. For example author talks or signings. You could probably extend it to subjects if you have a lot of workshops. If you have pictures or video of an author talk, why not link or embed it in the catalog page (while trying not to make the view too busy). Of course you can link to holdings on the event page as well.\nAnd since we\u0026rsquo;re on multimedia it would be nice if more talks were digitized (rights permitted of course) and available online. You not only let those who couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it see it, you also show what kind of services your library is providing that people might not be aware of.\nOverall I think there is plenty of room for improvement and events might be an overlooked area with all of the talk on the catalog.

As these are development versions I don\u0026rsquo;t want to overwhelm them with traffic. If you pop in #code4lib you\u0026rsquo;ll probably be able to get a peek at them.\nh3. What is Solr?\nIf you were at Code4Lib 2007 then you were probably beat over the head with Solr. If not then here is a very brief intro. Solr is currently an incubator project of the Apache Foundation, part of the Lucene project. The brief intro from \u0026ldquo;their site\u0026rdquo;:http://lucene.apache.org/solr/:\nbq. Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java search library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, and a web administration interface. It runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat.\nWhile that sums it up, it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you how truly useful it is. To begin with Lucene is a powerful full-text search engine. Solr builds on top of Lucene to add a plethora of features that make building search-centric applications much easier. Many of the projects I feature below are one-person spare-time projects which likely would have been more difficult to accomplish without Solr. Some of the features Solr provides:\n Ability to do all operations, including submitting new documents, over HTTP requests (GET and POST) XML data format (both input and output), making it easy to parse in many programming languages Ability to easily index a single field in multiple ways Hilighting of search terms in results Faceting of results Query-time boosting, meaning multiple interfaces with different results can be built on same index Lots of caching and replication features  Some of the \u0026ldquo;people who use it outside of libraries\u0026rdquo;:http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers include CNET and the Internet Archive.\nh3. A Live Example\nTo start off with a non-library example, here is some information about \u0026ldquo;Internet Archive\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;:http://archive.org/ change \u0026ldquo;to solr\u0026rdquo;:http://www.nabble.com/INTERNET-ARCHIVE-goes-SOLR!-tf3129097.html\nAfter two days with Solr they averaged about 5.4 queries per second on an index of approximately 575k+ items. Even with this type of load they were able to do it with a single 4GB RAM dual core machine (instead of the 3 they used before). They also averaged a 0.5 load with sar showing 80% resources idle.\nAs for their index they updated it every 15 minutes and didn\u0026rsquo;t really optimize it other then the schema. Most of the Solr install was stock and they even did their boosting on query-time. An example of their query parsing \u0026ldquo;is given in the email announcement\u0026rdquo;:http://www.nabble.com/INTERNET-ARCHIVE-goes-SOLR!-tf3129097.html\nh1. Some Library Examples\nh3. David Walker\u0026rsquo;s Solr Experiment\nWalker, \u0026ldquo;who has been working on many things\u0026rdquo;:http://public.csusm.edu/dwalker/, threw together a Solr catalog built on Innovative Interfaces data exports. Specifically he took tab-delimited data exports and imported them into Solr. He then wrote a PHP5-based interface to his Solr instance. While proof-of-concept right now there is hope that it might become something and possibly experiment with union catalog interfaces.\nHe also used Amazon data for the images and some review information on the item record page. One of the things that caught my eye was the item record view itself:\nOne of the challenges is getting live status information into the catalog. An easy solution is to just link to the vendor supplied catalog for the item pages. The solution here is to actually scrape the MARC view of the III catalog which supplies both the item information and it III\u0026rsquo;s case, the status info. This is then parsed to allow custom layouts to be created. The example above includes some Amazon data in addition to the normal stuff.\nh3. Ross Singer\u0026rsquo;s Solr Experiment\nThis Solr instance is interesting in the fact that it has more then just catalog data. While it has around 750k+ records in it, the records come from DSpace, the library catalog and EAD Finding Aids. He hopes to add Subject Guides and databases (e-resources). Dublin Core was used as a possible crosswalk and alignment of the disparate data. This leads to plenty of experimentation with ranking and display of information. It will be interesting to see something like this go live.\nAs for stats the development version was built by 1 person (Ross) mostly over a weekend. The instance runs on a 2GHz windows workstation. The interface is written in Ruby on Rails.\nh3. Fac-Back-Opac\nThis project is actually hosted on Google Code \u0026ldquo;so you can download it yourself\u0026rdquo;:http://code.google.com/p/fac-back-opac/ if you want to play with the interface. It is written in python with Django. From the project page:\nbq. The faceted backup OPAC project began with Casey Durfee\u0026rsquo;s Open Source Endeca in 250 lines or less presentation at the code4lib 2007 conference, where he claimed to provide faceted features similar to the Endeca and AquaBrowser experiences using Solr and Django.\nAgain the project is running on modest hardware, a standard PC with 1.5GB of RAM which is also running DSpace. In my testing it was quite responsive.\nh3. Project Blacklight\nYou can \u0026ldquo;read more about Project Blacklight at Bess' Blog\u0026rdquo;:http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/?p=75 and here\u0026rsquo;s a short description from it:\nbq. We need significant data cleanup and rationalization to make the facets user friendly. But overall, I\u0026rsquo;m impressed with what we\u0026rsquo;ve been able to accomplish in a few months, with no offical committment of staff time, using only our spare time, borrowed hardware, and good will.\nThere is also a link to a demo at the blog. I suggest checking this out as it uses a similar interface to that of \u0026ldquo;NINES' Collex\u0026rdquo;:http://nines.org/collex. What I\u0026rsquo;m talking about is the idea that everything is a facet, including your keyword. This means you start with the global facets already shown. You can add facets to limit things down, invert them to remove certain items and add keywords as additional facets. This makes it easier to do some more complex operations where you have some things excluded and some limited, without knowing the boolean or logic behind it. When you foray into the idea of using user-contributed or user-specific data, then it grows even more powerful. I could have the catalog show me things that were only in a certain location that matched my keyword that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t checked out before or isn\u0026rsquo;t on my current to-read list.\nI still think it\u0026rsquo;s a rather complex interface and can have a small learning curve to take advantage of all the features but it will be interesting to experiment with it to see how easy it can be made or how well people warm to the idea.\nFor the stats people there are 3.7 million records and..\nbq. The marc records are indexing through a ruby script Erik wrote, directly from marc, without transforming into marc xml first. The box it\u0026rsquo;s all running on is a development server, with four medium fast CPUs and 3.5G of RAM. Solr is running through Jetty, Blacklight is running on a pack of four mongrel instances, with apache doing load balancing out front. Sessions get written to a mysql database, and we use capistrano for deployment and versioning. And it sends us all an email every time an error gets generated.\nh3. Rob Casson\u0026rsquo;s Experiment\nRob has also been playing with Solr and you can see the now familiar facets. He\u0026rsquo;s also experimented with adding things like Refworks Export and item marking. One of the nice things about Solr is that it takes care of enough that it leaves time to experiment with the interface itself. Rob has also experimented with browse views using facets:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an interesting use of facets and similar to that of Collex and Project Blacklight, though it gives different starting point interfaces for the different paths. Something to mess around with. For the stat people, this was a two-person job with Rob using the help of his Authority Control Librarian to help clean up the data and experiment. It\u0026rsquo;s about 2 million records and mostly default install.\nh3. Dave Pattern\u0026rsquo;s Experiment\nDave is also messing around with Solr and was able to get something basic up in a couple hours of work. Be sure to \u0026ldquo;check out his blog\u0026rdquo;:http://www.daveyp.com/blog/index.php/archives/202/ for info on his trials. I played with it briefly but haven\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to do much with it. Link to a demo is there and I believe he plans on releasing the Perl source.\nh3. Conclusion\nHopefully this gives you an idea of what people are playing around with and that it\u0026rsquo;s not something you need a 20-person well-funded team to accomplish. Play around. There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of people on #code4lib that are playing with Solr although I\u0026rsquo;m sad I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the time yet to do more then interface experiments.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2007/04/solr-in-libraries/","summary":"Note: Many of the examples below only include screenshots.

It\u0026rsquo;s also a place that needs work for OpenID consumers.

The keynote on the first day of Code4Lib 2007was by Karen Schneider who writes at Free Range Librarian, among other places. You can view a video of her presentation on googleand download links should be available soon on the code4lib presentation page.\nThe presentation is well worth watching and I think was well received, despite a few hecklers in the crowd.\nKaren began with an overview of where we are and what\u0026rsquo;s wrong. Currently we\u0026rsquo;re often giving away our collections, leasing information from vendors and publishers without actually keeping anything ourselves. This is a topic that\u0026rsquo;s come to my mind many times when we have access problems to resources. A good chunk of our collect can disappear in minutes and it\u0026rsquo;s often outside the library\u0026rsquo;s control.\nA second point she made is that we are dependent on external tools as well and don\u0026rsquo;t build our own. The tools that we do have are needlessly complex and poorly marketed. I\u0026rsquo;ve had this argument with quite a few people and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to convey why the complexity is often needless. I hope more get it. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably devote more posts to this topic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll devote a separate post to this topic as I believe it\u0026rsquo;s really important but I\u0026rsquo;ll include Karen\u0026rsquo;s point that libraries don\u0026rsquo;t have lots of patrons, they have 1.5 patrons and 1.6 million hostages.\nSomething I need to think more about, but Karen pointed out that libraries are really in the business of memory work and that libraries often don\u0026rsquo;t recognize the business they are in. Preserve and provide access to cultural memories. This is important to keep in mind when you think back to the emergency things are in.\nThe 5-3-1 rule of Karen\u0026rsquo;s is to find 5 issues that are important, focus on 3 and make 1 happen. Five issues that important are standards adoption, digital preservation, crappy library software, 3rd party content and scholarly awareness of issues. The focus was preservation, software and awareness. The one thing those in the room could definitely make happen was the crappy software. Examples of some of the good things coming out were Evergreen, Umlaut, Scriblio and Solr.\nKaren stressed the importance of building solutions within the library. The reasons she gave was that it restores the balance of power, reinstates the direction of the profession, puts emphasis on the memory work and sends a message that we can do it and libraries matter. Other outcomes include decoupling, re-use of external projects (wordpress, etc) and re-socialization with external parties.\nThe Opac is the last thing anyone but librarians want to use. Karen\u0026rsquo;s comment was that it \u0026ldquo;was easier to ask their mothers for the answer\u0026rdquo;.\nSome generalizations made were that no one really cares about open source, just the experience, that ARL count has too much drive in planning, IT directors won\u0026rsquo;t take unfunded initiatives and most libraries can\u0026rsquo;t provide developers.\nDirectors want to know:\nDirectors often thing that open-source projects are lower quality, developer oriented, have no support model and are one beer-truck away from orphan software.\nProjects need to keep this in mind when trying to get adoption. The current Evergreen project site was used as an example of where things could be improved. In my talking with the Evergreen crew they agree completely. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been checking out open-source library projects myself to see what\u0026rsquo;s out there and I can confirm that most of their sites convey very little useful information for someone making decisions and not actually installing it. Don\u0026rsquo;t presume people have already decided.\nThere was a comment about if free software was free, price vs freedom, etc which was met with some debate. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that for another post.\nAnother topic I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write more on. She referred to it as biblio-creature-feep, the tendency of last-gen librarians to love systems that are needlessly complex that have to be taught to people but use comments like \u0026ldquo;our users need it\u0026rdquo;. Some ways to counter this is with analytics, usability tests, ethnographic studies, etc.\nAnd finally, every library needs a developer. Karen points out that there was a time without ILL and reference librarians and now developers are just as important as those. Libraries should keep that in mind.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2007/03/code4lib2007-karens-keynote/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m way behind in lots of things right now but I might as well post something.

But if they manage to get \u0026ldquo;COinS\u0026rdquo; right then there must be something good going. So without further ado here are some downloadable versions:\nJon Udell:Hi, this is Jon Udell. My guest for this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast is Dan Chudnov. He is a programmer who has worked on library information systems at MIT, at Yale, and soon at the Library of Congress, where he will be starting a new job shortly. This conversation is kind of a sequel to an earlier one with Tony Hammond of Nature Publishing Group. Tony talked about how digital object identifiers are being used in the world of academic publishing to create a stable, long-term framework for persistent linking and reliable citation.\nThere is a related technology called OpenURL that plays a role in academic publishing, but it is also something that Dan Chudnov are approaching from the perspective of libraries, that need citations to be not only durable and persistent but also to be able to redirect into the holdings of a particular library. It all sounds kind of esoteric, and in a lot of ways it is, but these questions of digital archiving and persistent linking will matter more and more, because we are all creating the library of the future.\nDan Chudnov:Hi Jon, how are you?\n Why don't we kind of start there, from the perspective of the various library-related linking and resource-identification standards that you have been involved in. So if you could sort of back up and state the problem first, in a way that everyone could relate to, that would probably a good place to start.   You want to be able to follow the references, essentially, and see which giant's shoulders they have been standing on, and verify that these people are building on the right combination of work when they are proposing a new idea or a new solution to a problem. Part of that is simply verifying that their statement of problem is accurate and they know what they are talking about; and the more important probably, progressive aspect of that is being able to verify scientific results and claims. So you need to be able to follow people's references if you want to do science.   Basically, what you want to be able to do if you are reading an article online, much like you would want to do if you have a physical copy of the paper, is when you are looking at the references you want to go and follow those references. You want to find which journals, which issues, which volumes, which pages these references people are citing, are relevant to your understanding of the problem you are trying to understand with the author's perspective. So, you literally need to go into the book stacks, the journal stacks, whatever, and find that volume, that issue, that page of that journal, so you can find the article, and this is exactly the problem as it translates to the Web that led to the development of the OpenURL standard seven or eight years ago. That problem is, you are using an online article, you are reading an article in an online journal, and at the bottom of the article there are a bunch of references. And the references aren't homogeneous in any way, in the sense that, well, they are probably formatted the same way visually, and there are obviously styles people use to keep that consistent--short form of the author's name, and a title of the article, and a short form of the journal title, and reference to volume, issue, year, page--but that is really hard to translate mechanically online for a couple of reasons. One is that metadata, first of all, is very sloppy. Author names are ambiguous, journal names can be ambiguous, journal names change every time journals split. Book titles are mistyped, misquoted, that sort of thing. There is a lot of slop in the system.   If we go back six or seven years that wasn't necessarily so at all. This is all actually very recent, that you could assume that most recent things would be online. But they are all published by different publishers, and the different publishers maybe publish the journals themselves on their own sites, or they contract with third parties to publish them for them in their own systems, or there are gateway systems that essentially aggregate resources from a variety of publishers into whole new interfaces. And when you are working at a big library like Yale University's libraries, not only are you going to have an unholy combination of all these subscription agents and aggregators and source publishers themselves subscribed to in your library, but the resources themselves are going to overlap. So, when you follow a reference link, what you need to know is whether you have that journal at your library, and not just whether you have that journal, but which system you can use to get to it, and within that which of those systems actually allow you the specificity of naming a volume, an issue, a page, an author name, a unique identifier, and can get you right to that article itself. What you really want to be able to do is bring people right to the full text of the article with one click. Unfortunately, with all these reasons, it is just not always that easy.   The identifier aspect of this is one big step in mitigating some of these issues, because if you have a known, unique identifier, you can recognize that as such and have a little more mechanical strength in trying to resolve it to a direct link. A lot of what you talked with Tony Hammond is in that space.  Dan:Yes. Other obvious kinds of identifiers are URLs in general, and PubNet identifiers if you are in a medical space, like I have been working in most recently. These are well-known, they are well understood, they are easily recognized, and they are usually fairly easily resolved.\n Now one of the jobs I have had in a previous life was I was wondering on the D-Space project at MIT Libraries about six years ago, and even just the \u0026amp;quot;how to generate IDs and resolve identifiers\u0026amp;quot; problem alone, on that project, was a source of endless debate, and not even... What we came up with isn't even necessarily something that pleases all parties all the time.   With the D-Space project, one of our exclusive goals was to solve this, and in many ways to support open access publishing by making it easier for authors and institutions to publish their own words by, as much as anything else, not only taking a copy of the content and offering to manage that over time, but also simply offering a stable URL. If you talked to a number of authors at MIT five years ago, they would line up right away and tell you that, sure, they had been publishing their own articles, but their graduate assistant system administrator had moved on, and the system had been compromised, and now the links don't work, and they have been publishing papers and now no one could get to their articles anymore. \u0026amp;quot;Yes, please take a copy of this for me and give me a stable URL that I can cite.\u0026amp;quot;   So in this particular sense I think there is an importance to the role of needing some sort of distributed identification resolution stuff, because if all the libraries put their eggs in one basket, with one centralized service, and then anything happened to that one centralized service, that is a traditional single point of failure problem: we simply can't provide the service we need to our communities. So negotiating this spectrum of what you need to centralize, what you need to distribute, is an ongoing and fairly difficult process.   And that is certainly the problem we can't ignore in libraries, and on that level we have hierarchies of authority and responsibility, from individual responsibility to organizational affiliation to networks of organizations; and in a sense this tapestry that is building out on the 'Net, this thing that is missing, is approximating the complexity of \u0026amp;quot;meet space\u0026amp;quot; that in some sense then maybe it is fully built. In another sense, maybe the tapestry doesn't work unless there are clear overlaps and interconnections between.   So, in fact, what it looks like happening here is, it seems very similar to what Tony was describing as the query process, going into the DOI and handle stuff, where you want to get back a concise identifier, but you need to ask the system, \u0026amp;quot;What would that be for these values?\u0026amp;quot; Is that a fair statement?   You are going to be able to go to an open-access copy of it. You are going to be able to go to an aggregated version of it in something like Lexus-Nexus, Academic Universe, that kind of resource, or a gateway subscription service like EBSCL. So you might get several copies of links that are all different, that are all going to take you to versions of the article; and below that you will get links to an interlibrary loan service if you aren't lucky about that. Now, another project I have been working on, and some other people in the community are trying to improve the step, is basically what you are doing is, not only are you presenting users who typically just want to get right to the full text with this confusing screen offering these options in the middle of which is the full text link, so just take me there darn it. You are also, you are moving users through three different systems at once. For every reference you want to follow, you need to come up out of the silo of content you started in, which might or might not be the same one you have to go back to a month later to get to the same article; step through the library's user interface; remember how to follow the links in there; and end up at the ultimate site, which might be, again, different from one month to the next depending on library subscriptions, which come and go and change over time as well. And that is really confusing. Every time one of my colleagues has reported to me, informally or more publicly, on usability testing results from OpenURL screens, the result is almost invariably, \u0026amp;quot;I think I know from this that if I click the first thing I will get to the full text, and I remember seeing it, so I do that.\u0026amp;quot; But they don't read it, they don't remember the different options, because these screens are typically just not that good yet. They need a lot of improvement. So, a project I am working on now, I have been consulting on this effort called LibraryFind, a metasearch project coming from the Oregon State University Libraries, funded by the State of Oregon. It is a metasearch tool which allows you to search multiple resources at once. We have basically embedded an OpenURL resolver into the result stream, so that when you do a search on someone's name, like yours, or a topic or the name of a book, hopefully what you are going to get are not just links to OpenURL resolver screens--we control the whole system, right? We have got these front-end-to-back-end searches that are licensed resources; and we have got the OpenURL resolver; and we have the knowledge base of which resources were subscribed to. So, what we are trying to do is reduce it to two clicks. You send your search query to find what you want, and if we can find a link directly to full text we are just going to give you that link right away in the results. So one click to find, one click to get. And when we have done usability testing on this, it is amazing. There is no question what it does. People instinctively want to just click on the result and get the full text of the article when you are doing article searching. And when we are able to provide that, which is in many cases, people don't even recognize what is happening, because the number of systems they have moved through has been reduced and the number of screens we were confusing them with has gone down. Of course, this doesn't always work. If you are doing book searching, you are trying to find a book, you are not necessarily going to find an e-book copy. So then we have to move you through data from the online catalogue, and figure out if it is online, and figure out where it is on the shelf and whether it is checked out. These problems just don't go away; there is always a possibility for great confusion. But we are trying to find ways, both through this project at Oregon State and a lot of other initiatives going on, to shorten these steps.   But on the other end of it, I want to cite this thing, and I want to cite it in a way that is canonical and durable. So, at that point, what does that part of the process look like? Where do I end up with the OpenURL that I want to point other people to?   And essentially what needs to happen at that moment is we need to restore metadata, we need a restoring metadata system; and in some cases, certainly when you have things like a reference object that you are passing by reference with an identifier, you can do that fairly reliably. If you have some combination of fields like title and author and pages and publication date, it's a bit more of a crapshoot. But if at all possibly you do want to be able to restore that full record, and in addition to providing a service which would lead people to full text, you do want to provide a canonical citation form.   We thought about what it would like if you could just track a community's OpenURL resolutions, and just have a stream that would show up, and a feed you could subscribe to, of all the references people are going to over time. And in a lot of ways this is what social bookmarking is: you are reading over people's shoulders, you are seeing what your friends are reading. What I think hasn't happened yet is for those two areas of functionality to really be bridged. I don't think there is an OpenURL resolver on the market that not only provides full text links and a citation form but also automatically lets you save a resulting citation into a community bookmarking service. But thinking about those issues led us to this other generic problem, which is, \u0026amp;quot;Well what if I'm--well, I'm working at Yale, which is lucky for me, I'm lucky to be there and they have great resources; but if I'm writing a paper and want to publish it on the 'Net, and I want to blog about it, how do I put up OpenURL links that other people can follow? This is a huge problem. We have come up with a temporary solution to that. Again, it is another community initiative, and this one is called COinS.   There are also blog plug-ins. I think there is one for Re-Press.   The problem, then, goes back to, how do you give people this thing they have to install? I mean, what we are learning is if you make people install something, they won't do it unless it comes with... you know, if you get Microsoft Office Suite or Firefox. If it is not something that is right there and one click away, it is not something people are going to find on their own.   And what we have done, I have worked with them to produce a simple database of Greasemonkey scripts and Bookmarklets for all the institutions in that registry, so that librarians can go and get one of these things and distribute it on their campus.   If you're a blogger, you're going to want to rely on one of these things like the WordPress plug-in or the Structure Blogging plug-in for removable type or Drupal.   You might have varying amounts of detail encoded in the queries, so some resolvers could go all the way down the page, other could only get you down to the article. So it seems you're set up to generate lots of different variance of that query, on the other hand that query is an URL that you want to function as an attention attractor, then you have to canonicalize that somehow. What is the canonicalized version of it?   So, when you think about an object of some platonic form, the surface area of the expressions of that object is pretty diverse. And the more popular something is, the more thorny shapes and little drop outs you're going to have over that topology. One of which is metadata representations of it that is essentially surrogate the in hand copy which you don't have when you're looking at it. Sort of by definition, there is loss between representing an object through metadata and the object itself. Particularly when it's hard to say what the object itself really is when we have PDF copies and HTML copies, AAC files and MP3 files and so on, and transcripts of the following.   There are a lot of norms to be developed. On the one hand, what you're describing seems to be likely, that a gradient will begin to develop between things that have a more of a permanent nature and things that don't. Systems will be refined and improved to support the things that have more permanence. But on the other hand there's this great phrase that showed up on a Book Arts Press annual mailing a few years ago. Mess is Lore.   But this is in some ways simply just what happens over time. To a large extent you really expect and hope that the best stuff gets kept reliably, but on the other hand we know that it doesn't.   I guess I would just like to hope that there's a business model for someone in enabling somebody like me who looks at blogging as really quite a professional activity. For me to be able to make a similar investment, it's my intellectual life and I take it very seriously and I constantly refer to things in the past that I have written and just the other day I had to try to go back to something in the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://byte.com/\u0026quot; \u0026gt;byte.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; archive from ten years ago and already that's problematic.   Certainly for academics the role of the institution in many ways is to promote and somewhat protect the reputation of a researcher or a professor by simply standing behind them and employing them on one hand if they are tenured and whatnot. But also archives exist to take on the papers of important scholars and members of the public sphere and authors, artists and organizations, governments, big companies. It is the ongoing imperative mission of archives and other libraries to do this work. So, until there is an organization that chooses as it's mission to preserve my bits as an individual, I can't assume that Amazon will or the Internet Archive will because I haven't made that arrangement with them.   If I have any influence at Microsoft, which I probably don't, at product development that would be one thing that I would love to nudge it's online properties in the direction of doing because I think it's something that a lot of people will ultimately want.   Or if you enter into an arrangement like that what do you end up doing when you recognize that literally publishing and republishing don't necessarily have to be disconnected? Should there be a permanent \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://wordpress.com/\u0026quot; \u0026gt;wordpress.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or long term \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://typepad.net/\u0026quot; \u0026gt;typepad.net\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or whatever the popular - \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://blogger.com/\u0026quot; \u0026gt;blogger.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, should there be a long-term \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://blogger.com/\u0026quot; \u0026gt;blogger.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; where it's not free, you pay. You pay maybe a lot more than you normally would and the presumption is the extra payment you make is in exchange for a long-term agreement to keep your work alive.   This was like a lot of fun.

The title of the book gets kind of mixed in though the status is easy to spot.

The ability to just login and browse the games you have available, easily purchase them and then have them available to play soon after.

I\u0026rsquo;ve now moved up to using the site fully and feel at least some trust. What I like is that:\nAs libraries move into the recommendation and discovery area they will likely keep more data around. Add to that user-generated information and you have a privacy and data concern. I think it will be important to look at sites like Wesabe and see what they are doing. Can your patrons easily read and understand your privacy and data retention policies? Can they delete all of the data easily? Opt-out of aggregated data?

There has been some discussion in the library blog arena about it. Here is a round-up and some thoughts. The article goes over traditional cataloging and folksonomy and concludes:\nand then also makes the statement:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t really see much evidence of \u0026ldquo;better results\u0026rdquo; in the article and I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen it in real life either. Some of the arguments that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen include that the article misses the social aspect and the \u0026ldquo;wisdom of crowds\u0026rdquo; as well as having an either-or mentality when they could augment each other. From dystmesis:\nAnd from Catalogablog, though a commenter disagreesthat the paper has an either-or position:\nI agree with some of the arguments for strict classification and that there are problems with tagging en masse, though I agree with others that there is probably a critical mass where useless tags get washed out. I don\u0026rsquo;t agree, however, that using relative meaning is inheritently bad or invalid. In terms of discoverability and findability, all possible interpretations can be helpful. It can also provide context for works such as ones which had a political reason for being published even though the work itself was not about politics. I think the most useful benefit of tagging is the relationships between items that can be made apparent through the interpretations. I do agree, however, that there will also be the need for controlled vocabularies in organizations.\nIt might be my background in science that plays a roll. With the advent of genetics it became apparent that some classifications were probably not correct, though it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes difficult to change. And whether controlled or not, some decisions in classification can be arbitrary. And when you get down to some systems what something is or isn\u0026rsquo;t turns into a statistic and the idea of duality becomes easier to fathom.\nIn the end I think both systems do an ok job though I tend to find more with tags on sites such as LibraryThing, though this might be the display and not the classification at work. Having more than one \u0026ldquo;classifier\u0026rdquo; means that the results can be weighted depending on how many have tagged it such.\nI guess I can\u0026rsquo;t end without an example. On Worldcat, 1984 has only two subjectswhich include London fiction and Totalitarianism. LibraryThing has some overlapbut adds things such as dystopia, political fiction and social commentary. Sure there are some erroneous tags in there but the popular tags are quite useful, especially with creating the \u0026ldquo;similarly tagged\u0026rdquo; items which give decent recommendations of relatedness from a quick glance. Similar to Worldcat\u0026rsquo;s results for the totalitarianism subject though with likely a bit more weighting. In the end, both are useful.\nI\u0026rsquo;d also like to point out that dystmesis also has a nice writeup on folksonomies and LibraryThingthat\u0026rsquo;s worth a read.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/11/dlib-philosophical-problems-with-folksonomy/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s a new issue of Dlib out with an article called \u0026ldquo;Some Philosophical Problems with Folksonomy\u0026rdquo;.

As with most things Artplans, it was worth the time. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be posting some more about some of the ideas that came about there but here\u0026rsquo;s a brief run-down.\nThanks to detroit traffic and a hotel without parking, I missed the continental breakfast. There was plenty of coffee left thankfully. The even then started with a presentation by Art (slides). He used some analogies such as cars. Cars have become increasingly complex but have a support structure (diagnostics, etc) that have evolved with them. ILS\u0026rsquo;s have gotten complex but have no such structure. He then went on to talk about the importance of evolution in library systems and not reinvention. He also decried the lack of metrics in many library areas. We know things are wrong but we don\u0026rsquo;t really know much detail about what\u0026rsquo;s really going on. Art\u0026rsquo;s a big proponent of using specialized components and hooking them together. Many businesses are moving from monolithic to specialized software that talk to each other (more from pmurray later). Accounting has accounting software, not an accounting module hacked together for the sprinkler system. There is good software out there for acquisitions and workflows, why not use them and spend the effort on making great systems talk to each other. The general take-home message he had was that the backend needs work too, not just the opac.\nFollowing up on Art\u0026rsquo;s ideas on the backend was Peter Murray\u0026rsquo;s talk on SOA in libraries. I\u0026rsquo;ve read on SOA but haven\u0026rsquo;t really kept up as I should. His main focus, that at least I picked up on, was the componentization of the ILS. Having discrete software that is specialized and have open protocols or paths for them to talk to each other. It fits well with the ideas Art has on using outside software and I also think such an architecture may be needed to allow rapid changes in workflow or collections, like the rise in ERM. There seems to be some work around NCIP and other ideas with some of the opensource ILS\u0026rsquo;s that may help support such an architecture in libraries. I won\u0026rsquo;t try to explain much else, browse pmurray\u0026rsquo;s blogif you want more info. There may be better or alternative models, i\u0026rsquo;m not sure.\nIt was nice to finally see a presentation about Evergreen instead of just the blog and other reading. The talk revolved around the history of the project and the challenges they faced. It was interesting to see their requirements and what they did to resolve them. Solid engineering work. The system architecture was really nice to see and the amount of redundancy was more then I expected. The storage system does appear to be a weak point but that appears to be common these days with some businesses moving to Amazon S3. It was also impressive to see that they were able to overcome the political issues, such as global library policies, which I think likely kill many consortia ideas.\nI think an important take-home is that they had very special needs and demands which most vendors aren\u0026rsquo;t going to support just due to the business case. This is the prime area where home-grown and open-source solutions shine as the modifications or building can be done in house. Having an architecture that allowed them to do feature-requests in a day didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt either. The reviews of the consortia project are good and I can only expect them to grow with the new software. Some links:\nI then ducked out of the symposium to talk with Beth Jefferson of Bibliocommons.

Perhaps as the Google and other projects go on the libraries involved will be able to share metadata or API\u0026rsquo;s for metadata that libraries who hold the items can use.\nI think automation will become increasingly important and automation might not be the best label. I think this category includes API\u0026rsquo;s and various other methods of resource sharing. Pulling ratings and descriptions from Amazon, relations and recommendations from LibraryThing and other services will help the catalog become more usable even if the metadata isn\u0026rsquo;t used in the search index itself.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t touch on her other points but I will agree that more consistent and structured data could help with some of the discover problems. For her example of geography-based recommendations I think a good real-world example would be Gutenkarteand that\u0026rsquo;s only one way of doing it. Again that\u0026rsquo;s dependent on having full-text or at least a controlled word list available.\nIn the realm of Amazon integration I think Athens County Library(Koha-based) is a nice example.

You also get the added ability of allowing reading lists, class lists, reserve lists and countless other uses that can come out of it. When using most catalogs I find the subject headings to be near useless, though that\u0026rsquo;s mostly an interface problem as you can\u0026rsquo;t often do intersections.

This project is an outgrowth of that initiative and our goal is to create a critical mass of Open Source Tutorials for online resources used by libraries everywhere.","title":"Library Screencast Tutorials"},{"content":"\u0026lt;div class='hreview x-wpsb-review-book'\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;h3 class='item fn'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a class='url' href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809057395'\u0026gt;The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0809057395.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_V62575464_.jpg\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Rating\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;rating\u0026quot;\u0026gt;5\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; out of 5\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;sb-fullstar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;sb-fullstar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;sb-fullstar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;sb-fullstar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;sb-fullstar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div style=\u0026quot;clear: left\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Author\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;: Sid Jacobson\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Year\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;: 2006\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Publisher\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;: Hill and Wang\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;ISBN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;span class='Z3988' title='ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book\u0026amp;rft.isbn=0809057395'\u0026gt;0809057395\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\t\u0026lt;div class='description'\u0026gt;Got this book from the local consortia.

All quotes are from the ebook and again I recommend giving it a read.\nMany libraries believe they need to be Amazon or Google or they\u0026rsquo;ll lose out. This misses the advantage libraries have of being smaller. They can offer a more personal service to the community. A library can offer one on one reference help, community workshops and outreach that others can\u0026rsquo;t. Someone browsing the web at the local coffee shop may be able to search Google, but they likely won\u0026rsquo;t have the chance of asking a question to a real person, that is unless your library is there. Most libraries are part of a community, they should probably take an active role in it.\nAs in any profession, libraries have jargon. There\u0026rsquo;s things like \u0026ldquo;serials\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;circulation\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;ILL\u0026rdquo;, etc. Though it can often save space to use umbrella terms, if it prevents people from finding services or the resources they need, it is likely worthwhile to explain exactly what is being offered.\nKnowing what terms people use and think of can also be useful. I often get calls from students who are told by professors to look for \u0026ldquo;peer-reviewed sources\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;primary material\u0026rdquo;. They are not aware that journals or indexes may be a place to look for them, as there is nothing on our site that says \u0026ldquo;peer-reviewed\u0026rdquo;. The use of primary in this case also tends to be different then what is considered primary on our site. This is usually where a reference librarian would come into play, but if the question is common it may also be a place for other outreach. Maybe it would be a good idea to prepare an \u0026ldquo;evaluating resources\u0026rdquo; handout for professors to give to students (including reference contacts), that breaks down the various sources they should use and how to find them at your library. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a sign that things should be reworded or a link to a guide should be made more visable. If your main audience is students, then common tasks and research guides should likely be moved to the forefront. If the majority need to start in indexes, then it will likely be worthwhile to make it easier to find and more apparent that it\u0026rsquo;s a good starting point.\nKeep up to date on what terms people are using when they ask questions and use them to your advantage.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/libraries-getting-real-people/","summary":"Continuing from my previous post, here are some more topics from 37signals' Getting Real ebook.

With the attempts to educate about \u0026ldquo;the scholarly crisis\u0026rdquo; there is really no excuse not to. Dchud touched on this in regards to the ILSbut it is really applicable to any contract-based or non-OA offering.\nSome of the other points include that eprints include licenses that aren\u0026rsquo;t applicable and that copyright is applied to OAI metadata itself. One of the ones that stands out is that libraries being members of organizations (Germany\u0026rsquo;s JSTOR according to this article) works actively against OA and in effect promotes \u0026ldquo;the scholarly crisis\u0026rdquo;. Something to think about.\nI also think there is another point which wasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned which is the support of DRM\u0026rsquo;d material. Most take on the argument that it\u0026rsquo;s a vendor interoperability problem. \u0026ldquo;If only apple supported this format\u0026rdquo; or if only everyone could support one format. That misses one of the points of DRM which is lock-in to specific platforms. Apple has their itunes/ipod, Sony had their own custom ones that never took off and Microsoft had one they tried to spread but even they are moving to a similar system as Apple with their new Zune. It just tends to hurt everyone but the platform provider. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that a standard could come about but whether anyone would rush to support it is another thing. eBooks is an area where this problem is present and libraries should be happy to see some vendors trying to do it without DRMand hopefully support and promote the efforts.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/libraries-thwarting-open-access/","summary":"Open Access News provides an english translationof some of the main points from a german post on how german libraries are thwarting OA.\nThe first point is that \u0026ldquo;only a small number of library journals are OA\u0026rdquo;.

I disagree to a point. I think if a patron is willing to drive to your library then there is really no good reason to deny them, especially if your a public institution. I think the problem lies more in the libraries then in OCLC\u0026rsquo;s offering. Here at Michigan State we allow anyone in Michigan to get a library card. We are also part of the MichiCardprogram which, among other things, makes us agree to not charge other member library patrons for the privilege. We don\u0026rsquo;t charge anyone as far as I know. After all, these are people who pay taxes. Multiple other universities and colleges are also part. I do question our policy of not lending CD\u0026rsquo;s and DVD\u0026rsquo;s to community borrowers, however.\nI can see the arguments some have for \u0026ldquo;serving their immediate community\u0026rdquo; better, but it might be time to re-question what our \u0026ldquo;immediate community\u0026rdquo; is, especially in the light of a networked world. Our library does get calls from other countries and we can\u0026rsquo;t serve everyone. I usually use this as a point to education about ILL programs. That said, I think there\u0026rsquo;s very few people who actually come through our doors that would be sent home empty handed.\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s just me, but it seems odd to see lots of libraries talking about how to increase usage, serve patrons and make themselves more relevant but then also see them turn away people who actively want to use their library. Just seems backwards to me.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/worldcat-and-patrons/","summary":"A post caught my eye over at Library Stuff about patrons that may find something in OpenWorldCatand head over to the library in question thinking they\u0026rsquo;ll get the book, only to be greeted by this:\nPhoto by rooneg.\nThe post goes on to recommend OCLC design something so that patrons don\u0026rsquo;t see things from libraries they can\u0026rsquo;t borrow from.

The article goes over the podcasting pilots at University of Michigan\u0026rsquo;s School of Dentistry.\nOne of the first findings was that most students seemed to prefer audio over video, which they attribute to being more portable. This is despite the students actually originally requesting video, which shows that it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile doing more indepth studies like this. This was a good thing, as moving to audio only provided a large reduction in staff time. They also looked at different ways to record the audio, including students with ipods. They found that a computer hooked to the PA system provided the best audio for the price, however.\nThe second thing they did that I think is worthwhile looking at is automating the process. They made it so students could record the lecture by double-clicking an icon on a computer. Once the lecture was over the student stopped it, entered some metadata, and the program took it from there.\nThey also studied distribution methods. The files were provided in both MP3 and AAC. About half used each, with those using AAC preferring it due to the ability to bookmark and speed up/down the audio. For those that may be confused, AAC is a standard codec, not one by Apple (Apple added a DRM layer to AAC for the iTunes store).\nThey provided these files via a centralized website, course websites and RSS. They found the centralized site was preferred as well as RSS (true podcasting).\nSome other points made include Intellectual Property and faculty buy-in. They chose to put the podcasts and audio files behind authentication. Integration with Sakai may also come out of the project and includes interest by Apple.\nThe full article is worth a read if your looking into podcasting in an elearning context or otherwise.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/podcasting-lectures-educause/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s an interesting article in the latest EDUCAUSE Quarterlythat\u0026rsquo;s available online.

It would be nice to have a system that allows patrons to chat with support via the website similar to above. Behind the scenes would be a server that multiple support staff would be logged into. The server then routes the incoming question to an available staff, spreading the load among users. This gives a single entry point for users but allows multiple staff to participate. There are multiple libraries for jabber for web-based languages and I think some complete web clients. The big part would be designing the routing system. It also may already exist. Another possible interface would be to list the available reference or support with some of the specialties (and their status) and allow the user to choose.

Library Web Chic has also noticed some of these problems.In order to try to do my part I\u0026rsquo;ve made some changes. I apologize for any aggregators marking things as new.\nOne of the items that have come up in many discussions is for you to choose a format and support it. Offering the same content in multiple formats can just lead to confusion. It also leads to more work trying to keep things validated and working. You can still have more that one feed (comments, posts, etc) but should stick with a format. From Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s best practices:\nNick Bradbury (of TopStyle and FeedDemon) also recommends this route for an additional reason:\nAll my feed URLs (outside of comments) should point to the same feed now.\nDue to me changing domains and unstable hosting, I had moved my feed to feedburner. This gave me nice things like stats for subscriptions and items. Recently they changed their service, making the item URLs very ugly. This likely doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter for many but my feed is announced in IRC. This, coupled with validation errors, has let me to stop redirecting to the feed. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m leaving the Feedburner feed up and working. However, I may remove it in the future. If you subscribe to that feed please change it to the new final one. I will do my best never to move it again.\nDuring my work with syndication feeds I\u0026rsquo;ve found various problems that would cause anguish. The first thing I would do is to look and see whether it was valid to do something, so I would know whether I could complain to the creator or not, or if it was a bug in my code. I found the many RSS formats were fairly ambiguous. Usually it was much less so with the Atom spec. Due to this I have decided that the format I will support is Atom 1.0. I have modified Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s feed to provide valid Atom, which supposed is slated for a future Wordpress release. My feed provides both excerpts and full text. If you use an aggregator such as Bloglines you should be able to display either. I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain about other aggregator support but Atom support seems to be getting better and better.\nThis, of course, was my choice based on my experience. You may choose to support something else. If you notice anything weird with my feed, please let me know in the comments. The comment feed is still RSS 2.0 and I\u0026rsquo;ll likely change that in the future as well.\nRemember to validate your feed. Now I just need to do something about the website itself.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/update-my-syndication-feed/","summary":"I went ahead and updated Wordpress to the newest version and decided to try to fix my feeds while I was at it.

In terms of libraries the long tail is probably easiest to understand as the library has a few books that get the most circulation while the majority of the holdings get little circulation. For most book publishers the high selling would be the new books, new to paperback, etc while older books barely sold and of course, out of print not at all. To get a better understanding I recommend reading the following:\nThis is one of those areas where I think it is worthwhile to think of libraries as businesses. It costs money to house books. In order to save costs many libraries become part of consortia to spread holdings out and many weed through their collection for items that can be removed to make room for new ones. The thing to note is when your removing low circ items your affecting the long tail and the question to ask is could this item be a more in demand item if people could find it. Many businesses go the route of just carrying the most popular items, but how can libraries take advantage of their already large collection. In other words, making that collection earn it\u0026rsquo;s keep.\nAgain I recommend reading both of Lorcan\u0026rsquo;s posts above as he puts things better than I can. There are a couple ideas that I think should be stressed though in the case of libraries. These are also important when thinking about \u0026ldquo;next generation catalogs\u0026rdquo;. I think the ALA post got it right when they stressed the ability to find things easily.\nOne of the main problems I have with library catalogs is that it is difficult to find things unless you know exactly what your looking for. There\u0026rsquo;s many reasons for this that I won\u0026rsquo;t get into, but right now many libraries just have an inventory system. One of the ways NetFlix and Amazon make their large holdings worth the cost is suggestions. The majority of the movies I\u0026rsquo;ve rented from NetFlix have been suggestions and it\u0026rsquo;s one of the things that keeps me coming back. I have not used the feature at Amazon to the same extent though it has come in handy quite a bit when researching products. The simple things like \u0026ldquo;people who read this also like this\u0026rdquo; are well worth the effort to add. Many libraries already have circ statistics but they aren\u0026rsquo;t being put to full use.\nFor research libraries this would likely be a little more difficult but there is still plenty of room for improvement. Better metadata and linking between texts would help. Unfortunately much of this would require more digitization, which leads me to:\nO\u0026rsquo;reilly has probably taken advantage of this the most (with Safari), though Google Book Search has the same premise. Amazon is also beginning to take advantage of it. Many books are hard to find because of limited metadata. There\u0026rsquo;s been many times I\u0026rsquo;ve missed books in the catalog because table of contents weren\u0026rsquo;t included or the title was not descriptive. In many cases you really need some sort of full text or at least a term index for the work in order to make it findable and useful. This seems especially important in science related works but is probably important elsewhere. I think it will be really interesting to see how some of the Google Libraries put their digitized works to use.\nThe ideal of course is offering instant online access but when not possible this doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be the case. I think Amazon will be one to watch as they push sales through full-text while not actually providing the full text online in all cases. Regardless this is something worth watching and it will be interesting to see if the possibility of sharing indexes comes about.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/07/the-long-tail-and-libraries/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve posted a bit about the long tail before but figure I probably should again after a recent post on the ALA TechSource.

Here\u0026rsquo;s some posts worth giving a read:\nLibraryMan\u0026rsquo;s post was in response to those who believe all services should be free as it\u0026rsquo;s a public institution. David Lee King picks it up and discusses why some additional services could be charged for while the \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; services would remain free. There\u0026rsquo;s some debate in the comments which are worth reading.\nLet me first start off and say that I use NetFlix and love the service. They\u0026rsquo;re prices have gone up over the years but it\u0026rsquo;s still at a point where I find it an attractive alternative to spending my entire life in World of Warcraft instead.\nI personally would like to see all services as free. Having said that I can see where some libraries would need to charge for some expensive services they can\u0026rsquo;t afford but there\u0026rsquo;s a demand for. For example, there seem to be plenty of libraries that charge for ILL requests. Mailing heavy books isn\u0026rsquo;t the cheapest and some may be only able to cover part of the cost. If they\u0026rsquo;re able to keep it cheap then I would prefer a library offer the service versus not offering it at all because it can\u0026rsquo;t be done for free. There are probably even more libraries that charge for photocopies. A fee service is a fee service, no matter how small.\nAnother example is home delivery. Delivering books to people would not be the cheapest service to offer. It would also not have as high a use as other, cheaper services might. But there are likely people in the community who would benefit from such a service and who would be willing to pay alittle to get it. In talking with Alan Gray of Darien Libraryabout this, he had an idea of using a box a month model. You get a box which you can have filled with whatever books you like. You pay a monthly fee and the box gets picked up and delivered. There was even the idea of piggy backing on local delivery services such as pizza and flowers to save a few dollars in personnel.\nOne of the ideas that commenters had a problem with was that of weighted holds. Paying to get to the top of the heap in that sense would likely not work out well. However, AADLis currently doing something related called Zoom Lendswhich from what I hear works well and is fairly popular. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I completely understand how it works but I\u0026rsquo;m sure Blybergwill correct me if not.\nThe general premise is that some popular books get LOTS of holds. The library itself has some sort of buying strategy where if there are so many holds for an item then they likely go out and get another copy. In addition to that they also have Zoom Lendsshelves at the various libraries. On these shelfs are copies of popular books as well. If you pay a buck a week you get the ability to checkout from these shelves. No holds and no requests, if it\u0026rsquo;s there it\u0026rsquo;s yours, if not then there\u0026rsquo;s probably something else. I believe the lending period is also reduced for these. So the hold queue for the books stay the same but those in Zoom Lends collectively buy extra copies of books which they can checkout from. I almost see it as a library within a library.\nIn general I think libraries should strive to provide everything for free. Having said that, I believe there are some niche services that may be worthwhile to implement due to the people it could help, but which may require some sort of fee due to the low demand and cost to implement. If demand in the service grows then ways to fund it for free could likely be developed. If the service is never offered then there will likely never be enough demand to have it offered on a free basis.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/06/fee-services-in-libraries/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s been quite a few posts lately, led by LibraryMan, about whether or not libraries should replicate parts of NetFlix.

As can be expected, google and amazon (among others) come up and there is argument over whether we should follow their lead in order to \u0026ldquo;stay relevant\u0026rdquo;. I personally think that trying to copy others will do nothing but produce another failure. Instead, it would probably be better to take on some of the other \u0026ldquo;web 2.0\u0026rdquo; qualities that many companies have. In order to get a feel I suggest giving a read to 37signals' Getting Realwhich I quote from below. It will give you an idea of some of the things you should keep in mind when working on a web presence or application.\nWhether you like to admit it our not you will likely have to change in the future. The question then becomes can you change and how easily can you do so. For most it\u0026rsquo;s likely a painful process. Training, blackbox tech, inflexible systems and organization buy-in are all contributers. For libraries to become more nimble and responsive to change then there will likely have to be quite a few changes to the work environment and the backend of the systems.\nIt is probably worth looking at Open-ILS\u0026rsquo;sOpenSRF framework in this regards, and their general architecture as well. I have a feeling that it will make change a bit easier, but a good chunk is over my head. As for the environment there will likely have to be a change in attitude where change is welcomed and not feared. Reading some of the library blogs makes me think this is also taking shape.\nThe take-home is that, unfortunately, change is expensive as it currently stands for many libraries. This needs to change.\nYou can have the most flexible system, lots of meetings and testing, but in the end you\u0026rsquo;ll get some things wrong. If you\u0026rsquo;re depending on the vendor, then they will get things wrong. Can you react and fix it? You thought you had the hottest idea but no one liked it. Can you tweak it into something better or drop it completely? Or are you stuck until the next release cycle or the next time the committee is reformed?\nIt also seems that many still have the mindset of spending months \u0026ldquo;perfecting\u0026rdquo; a site or application, releasing it to the public and then promptly leaving it stagnant until 3 years down the road when they form another committee and repeat the process from scratch. Releasing a completely new presence it likely worth it occassionaly, but things should never be left stagnant. There are always things to tweak, enhance and fix. One of the qualities of \u0026ldquo;Web 2.0\u0026rdquo; applications you may want to replicate is that of iterations. Sometimes the changes will be small, other times large, but there\u0026rsquo;s always change. You adapting to what people need when they need it.\nSure some of these things may be fads and some may not work out, but if your able to change cheaply then the advantage of staying useful and pertinant to people likely outweighs it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m hopeful to keep a Getting Real series going for a little bit as there are a few other topics in the ebook that are worth noting. Again I recommend purchasing a copy.","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/06/libraries-getting-real-change/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s been quite a few discussions lately about what the future library catalog should look like and how it should function.

Leaving the competition idea to the side, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that many libraries likely have different missions and different audiences. Trying to make a catch-all interface will likely just make things worse. I\u0026rsquo;ve read plenty of complaints that generic tools like google and amazon fail to provide what they believe their patrons need.\nIn reality there are libraries that likely focus on preservation, ones that focus on research in a specific subject area, ones that are general research and ones that serve the general public but have a unique community to serve. There will likely be overlap between the libraries, as they all have similar holdings, but each catalog will likely be different in some way.\nThis brings me to what I think is going to probably be the most important feature of the \u0026ldquo;next generation catalog\u0026rdquo;:\nI think flexibility will be key. Currently many interfaces that are used were designed for one audience: librarians. Unfortunately many of these interfaces are also rather rigid so customization is limited at best. In response I see many hooking their ILS into other interfaces such as metasearch through z39 or other methods. Others are going the drastic route of exporting all their holdings into a completely different system.\nA recent post at Lorcan\u0026rsquo;s blogoutlined the research the University of Minnesota is doing with regards to facilitating Undergraduate research. They have some interesting ideas and some of their programs are likely useful. If the catalog itself was more flexible they could likely do even more.\nAs quoted above creating environments and workflows for particular communities will likely become important in the future. Unfortunately, again, most current catalogs seem inflexible and so many integration attempts depend on elaborate hacks and are probably a stretch to be referred to as \u0026ldquo;integration\u0026rdquo;.\nThe \u0026ldquo;next generation\u0026rdquo; catalog will likely not exist on it\u0026rsquo;s own at all but be part of something else such as a workflow, research tool or community portal. What that looks and behaves like will likely depend on the audience and the mission. I think this will not just affect the search interface but also things like error messages, result display, tools available, etc.\nIn short I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep a couple of questions in mind:\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/06/the-flexible-opac/","summary":"The above is from OK/Cancelwhich I recommend giving a read if you do any usability or interface work.

It\u0026rsquo;s a small public library that\u0026rsquo;s doing it\u0026rsquo;s best to stay relevant to the community. Some of the programs he discussed were quite inspiring.\nOne of his concerns was the technology side of things and that there was no way for his library to hire full-time programmers to accomplish some of the things other libraries, such as AADLare doing. I threw out a few ideas such as companies like LibLimebut that I would have to think about it more. It was a very difficult problem which is worth some discussion. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure exactly what\u0026rsquo;s best but figure I should throw out some of my current thinking to get things going.\nThe idea is to make software and other solutions created by libraries and reusable as possible so that other libraries can implement what\u0026rsquo;s out there without reinventing the wheel or expending as much resources as the original. Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, there are libraries that won\u0026rsquo;t be able to do this sort of thing.\nThe first problem is the reliance on hacks. Many solutions are so dependent on library specific hacks that using them anywhere else would be nearly impossible. A possible solution to this would be the idea of abstracting the vendor layers as much as possible and use a standard input instead.\nFor example, I threw together a quick OpenSearch module based on the III XML Server. In hindsight it would have probably been better to build it on a standard layer and then make a library to convert from this standard to III XML and back. Some of the benefits:\nSo what should this standard be? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet. From talking to various people it seems like SRU/W is a good candidate for search-based applications. The data format? MARCxml seems like a likely candidate. There\u0026rsquo;s still questions regarding holdings formats.\nI got this idea from David Walkerwho did a similar projectfor likely different reasons. He needed a way to hook the INNOPAC into a metasearch product and that product happened to support SRU. I think it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to build more and more on top of that.\nCons: An additional layer, performance, etc. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are plenty but at this point I think the benefits likely outweigh it.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s very important that things created by libraries should be usable by other libraries. A major potential barrier to this would be licenses that prevent people from freely using it. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what, if any, licenses would be the best for this. Some prefer GPL, others like BSD, Apache, etc. Probably a point worth discussing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll again use LibLimeas an example as I got the chance to talk to kados about it. LibLime is a company that supports open-source software in libraries such as Koha. They also do custom development of software that works on top of other vendor products. One of their requirements though is that the software they create on contract will be open-sourced so that other libraries (and liblime) can reuse what was created. I think this is a great idea. When a library that can afford to contract for an item has it created, all libraries benefit.\nI think community will play a large roll as it created a cheap form of help and support. Right now I think #code4libfills that role well. How well it would scale I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain, but it would be something to keep in mind.\nDocumentation is also a roll the community can serve which some of use are doing for the III XML server, an expensive and poorly documented product.\nThis is the first version of this idea and I will likely change my mind next week about it but please feel free to post comments or trackbacks with ideas or critiques.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/06/sharing-code-between-libraries/","summary":"Awhile back I attended Library Camp and was lucky enough to have some dicussions with Alan Gray of the Darien Library.

I checked the Community Guidelinesand sure enough, selling things via your stream results in termination. Obviously I removed them immediately. The guidelines are a little vague though. I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain if you can take pictures of things you create/sell offline or elsewhere but don\u0026rsquo;t actually sell via the stream (paypal links, etc). Regardless I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the chance.\nAnother thing that some people might miss is that Flickr counts itself as photos only. If you upload mostly screenshots or non-photo items then your likely to have your stream removed from the search. They won\u0026rsquo;t terminate though at least. There\u0026rsquo;s a recent article at Wired about a crackdown on such accounts. I think a good majority of their users are guilty of posting such things, especially with the popularity of things like World of Warcraft and Second Life. If you one of those Second Life librarian and go screenshot happy then don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if you account stops showing on search.\nAnother important (and vague) guideline is the website buttons. Flickr obviously doesn\u0026rsquo;t want you hosting all of your graphic files for you site on their servers. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some library blogs post graphics they made (L2 complient, L2 library, etc) just for show. However if someone starts linking to the icon on their website it may result in those accounts being removed. It\u0026rsquo;s something worth noting and being careful about.\nAccording to the article they are working on better and updated guidelines. I\u0026rsquo;m still a fan of flickr but hopefully they see that their site has taken on it\u0026rsquo;s own life and is no longer just a \u0026ldquo;photo sharing\u0026rdquo; but a \u0026ldquo;digital image sharing\u0026rdquo; one. And many times a screenshot is just a photo of a digital world.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/06/flickr-guidelines/","summary":"Awhile ago I was selling an item on ebay.

One hack to force people to link to an item is to create a repository and then link to the items in a master course. If someone copies the master course it is still a link.\nAnother common problem I\u0026rsquo;ve seen is quizzes in libraries. If you link then all the information is submitted to the library. The solution again is to use a master course. You can create the question banks in the resource library and then pull them into the master course (new quiz shell). When the master course is copied you get the links to the content items and real quizzes but the quizzes still pull the questions from the library so you can update the questions there and have all affected courses updated.

The presentation went over problems and workflows that were just too complex to expect faculty to complete.\nOriginally a SLN(apparently lotus notes based??) user they moved to ANGEL and experienced some problems getting the data moved over. His solution was to transform content to an ANGEL Archive that could then be imported by the professor. He used XSLT among other things.\nA second problem was Word HTML that many tried to copy and paste into the LMS which usually caused formatting problems. His solution was to use regex to strip some of the problematic tags and again transform it into something professors could easily upload.\nA third problem was multimedia. While most can do recording, to give a good experience for an online course they prefer to have it encoded in multiple bitrates and uploaded to a streaming server. They also like to include synced transcripts,SMIL,etc. His solution was to create a program using the Window Media SDK that would convert the media file for the professor. The application then takes their credentials and uploads the file to the streaming server, which automatically creates a playlist file. The application then takes this information and creates a HTML page with the embedded information and any metadata information the instructor included and posts it to ANGEL as a normal ANGEL Lessons Object (the professor can choose where to publish it to). We also have a streaming server so I found this very interesting as a help with workflow. He accomplished this by creating an ASP page that acts as an API for him, posting information to the database and returning some of the lists as XML.\nSeeing some of the workflows that are possible with some small hacking (there is an actual API that might be usable instead) gives me hope that quite a few problem/advanced areas we have could become alot simpler in the future. Desktop integration would be one. I had also played around with the ANGEL Archive format and had played with some XSLT for it but I can see now that it may be even more useful that I thought and worth messing around with.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/06/aug2006-dont-play-it-again-sam/","summary":"This presentation was by Peter Friesen of Plattsburgh State University of New York and probably had the most take-home ideas of any.

It helps to see what other people are doing with a product and how they are taking advantage of certain features. There\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit that can be done with some of the tools we\u0026rsquo;re not taking advantage of.\nFor those who don\u0026rsquo;t know ANGEL is a Learning Management System. Most will be familiar with the 800lb gorilla Blackboard or the OSS option of Sakai. The software was initially started at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis but was eventually spun off as a company. Talking with the people involved I was fairly impressed with their enthusiasm for the product and it\u0026rsquo;s future. There is a bit of a family attitude to it. While there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of things I\u0026rsquo;d like to see change, overall I\u0026rsquo;m fairly happy with it. I also think now that some of it is just likely limited by our understanding of the product or policies in place.\nNot being a morning person I wasn\u0026rsquo;t completely conscious during this session but it did have some interesting points. The people involved were also very enthusiastic about their work. Kentucky apparently has some higher education problems where they are not getting as many students through college. The use of online courses may help turn this around. They are also using it for student co-op and partnerships with local businesses. An interesting note is when talking to businesses they work with they never mention \u0026ldquo;distance education\u0026rdquo; as it has too many negative connotations (complex and expensive). They use \u0026ldquo;elearning\u0026rdquo; instead. The two demands by businesses is flexibility and support for languages such as spanish. ANGEL is fairly flexible and now has language packs. Online courses also work great for businesses compared to other education/co-op environments. Schools can use the assessments to match up students with prospective employers. They are also useful for employers that give education assistance as a benefit. Employees no longer have to wait to use their benefit but instead can find open entry/open end (rolling enrollment) courses to get them back in the game. The feeling is that you need to get them back into education sooner than later or they never will.\nIn order to bring more money into the state they are also marketing their offerings as widely as possible in order to bring in the out-of-state tuition dollars. They recommend listing your online programs in as many \u0026ldquo;online education directories\u0026rdquo; as possible. ClassesUSAwas one of the examples.\nOverall the feeling is that elearning may help both businesses and students that have previously had problems in educational settings.\nANGEL is growing quite a bit so there are fears by some that they could easily turn into another Blackboard or WebCT (almost all attendees had horror stories). Most of the presentation was an attempt to alleviate these fears by showing some of the things ANGEL is planning and why their different.

I actually have no problem with exposing, as you can do what you want, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s very helpful as is and would hope if more libraries do it that Google takes action and moves the results to the bottom. The information on most OPAC\u0026rsquo;s pages are only useful to a few people and it would make more sense to have it only show up when they include the library name or something similar. It looks ok know and seems like it might be a good idea to have it wide open and high results but that\u0026rsquo;s only because very few are doing it. When I search for an author or book the last thing I want is 20 pages of results for different libraries that all tell me nothing. Casey does include a link to WorldCat but it presumes you know what \u0026ldquo;worldcat libraries\u0026rdquo; is.\nNow I should say that I think library holdings in search engines are a great idea and the way to go in the future but I have some caveats:\nI think Google could pull something off that was useful. I like their displays when you search for a bandor album. I\u0026rsquo;d like to see something similar when you search for an author or title. Google could work with libraries, oclc and others to get the dataset they need to group information such as this. OpenWorldCat within Google. Libraries/Worldcat could then be featured without clogging up results. I think Google could also expand their openurl or something they use with Google Book Search to general results. Those with an account could then choose their library and have it linked to from applicable results.\nIf I sound like I\u0026rsquo;m saying that library results aren\u0026rsquo;t useful it\u0026rsquo;s because I find many aren\u0026rsquo;t. A link in Amazon that says my library has an item is pretty useful. 10,000 results for different libraries when I\u0026rsquo;m trying to look up some information online isn\u0026rsquo;t. I do have to point out an exception though: rare out-of-print books. For books that only a few libraries hold it makes sense to let people know a print copy is still available as it might be worth the time and frustration to get. Again something like worldcat is often used and could be a help in this area.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure some disagree, feel free to write up your own opinion.

Again this is available online so you can see everything yourself. A couple general observations is that blogger seems to be the host of choice. This is true with some of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on our campus as it is free and easy to use. One thing that wasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned (unless I missed it) in either of these presentations was privacy concerns. If you have students posting to a public blog in some way for a course you need to make sure your complying with your state or institutions privacy policies. You may have to give other, more private options to students then posting on the blog.\nBlogs are another hot topic in highered and the integration with online courses has come up multiple times here. This presentation went over the very basics of blackboard vs. blogs. We don\u0026rsquo;t use blackboard at MSU so I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for it. Here there are a few options. You can load the blog within a frame or you could use some sort of RSS2JS service to pull in the headlines. Since the presentation was mostly stuff I knew I actually found the comments more insightful. They talked about faculty education and support in regards to the tools available for them and the importance of that. As distance ed support I\u0026rsquo;ve come across this numerous times and have even helped faculty at other institutions that happened to call our number. It sometimes amazes me that some institutions don\u0026rsquo;t have as robust support as something as technical as online courses require. The support might be there, though, and just be an awareness issue. I think the departments on our campus could do more with advertising services, including the library.\nThis presentation was in regards to using blogs as a place for collabortive discussion for students from different cultures to learn from each other. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen similar blog posts around the edusphere about middle school and other young classrooms doing similar things for \u0026ldquo;pen-pal\u0026rdquo; type relationships.

In this way you can use the stock OPAC but still add functionality externally. I\u0026rsquo;ll give an example below and some other ideas at the end.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s start with an example. Our library doesn\u0026rsquo;t use the stock recall functionality. They prefer to do it themselves and so have a webform that patrons can fill out. But lets say we want to include a button or link in the OPAC that only shows up on specific criteria. This would likely be difficult in the stock set-up but if you use your own script coupled with the xml server you can pretty much set any criteria you want. You could have all items checked out and at least one requestable, only for books already checked out for a certain period of time, not available online, etc.\nThere are a couple ways to accomplish this, though in both you are passing the bib number to an external script. One is to wrape an image in a link with the image having the src of the script. The script then returns a button image if it matches criteria or a 1x1 blank pixel image if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, to prevent people from seeing or clicking on it. The other alternative is to have script tags where the src is your external script that document.write outs a link if it passes criteria or nothing if not, via javascript.\nSo how do you pass the bib number to an external script?

There are times when doing video makes sense and then there are times when audio would likely be preferable. He does give some good recommendation like doing topic-centric segments which helps students find the information they want. The presentation also mentioned syndication which is an important aspect and is sometimes overlooked by those in education. Posting material online is not \u0026ldquo;casting\u0026rdquo; in itself. Having multiple modes of access though is helpful though. The presentation was a worthwhile watch.\nLegal issues were also touched on in the first presentation (remove copyrighted works from your lecture slides), but this presentation went much more in depth and was broken up into two parts. The first part was an introduction to podcasting and to copyright law. It then went into what types of copyrighted content you may find yourself attempting to use in podcasts and what you can and can\u0026rsquo;t use. There was a nice mention of creative commons. The second part of this presentation was about what educational uses are allowed. I won\u0026rsquo;t bother recapping all the points of either of these presentations.

That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I find it any less useful though, as it brings all the benefits of RSS to other forms of media.\nAs a former education major (and now distance learning support) I have a real interest in it\u0026rsquo;s use in courses, especially ones online. Having this media in the form of podcasts/vodcasts/etc allows easy use by those that want the content. Students can subscribe to lectures (video or audio), articles or information (itunes supports PDFs) or just view the information in the course.\nThere was a talk on campus I think last fall regarding podcasts in our LMS (learning management system\u0026hellip;blackboard, etc). Right now it is very difficult to include this sort of functionality right into the course and about all you can do is provide the link to the podcast or upload the files to the course yourself. This is far from ideal. RSS is in the same boat with our LMS as there isn\u0026rsquo;t much support yet. You can bypass this by using some of the RSS2JS services that are out there. Unfortunately I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a similar services for podcasts, so I built a prototype instead.\nIn simple terms all it does it take a URL for an argument and then output the information via document.writes into the browser. This lets you include the information into any normal html page with no need of having server side parsing on the server in question. I also passed the enclosure URL to a flash-based mp3 player. In the screen below I\u0026rsquo;m using the Odeo flash player though there are many available out there and ideally you would have one customized for the institutions. I\u0026rsquo;ve blanked out the URL as it\u0026rsquo;s not really production worthy. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested if someone created such a service though. Odeo currently offers HTML for individual shows but doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anything for full feeds.\nIn the example above the feed only has one show but it allows you to specify how many and will have a seperate box for each. I also include a link to download the mp3 file in case someone wants to save a specific show. The point of this is to allow you to show the most recent shows right inside your course or site (opac, etc). I\u0026rsquo;ve also provided the information and links to allow the student or user to subscribe to the podcast in their aggregator of choice. This allows them to consume the audio how they see fit. If there is an enclosure that isn\u0026rsquo;t an mp3 then I link to it instead as shown in the screen below.\nSomething like this has many uses though I would really prefer something that is built in. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested if anyone has something production-worthy already done. Mine is more of a proof-of-concept hackjob, though it mostly works.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/03/podcasting-and-the-lms-podcast2js/","summary":"Podcasting still seems to be taking off, especially in the academic worlds.

This includes pulling data from other API\u0026rsquo;s or supplementing it with your own programming. Most of the stuff has been discussed on various blogs. The one thing that was new was the virtual reference. When someone accesses the virtual reference chat from the opac it will pass a session number that the reference librarian can use to view the person\u0026rsquo;s current search session, making it easier to identify problems with their searching.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have slides to look over but I vaguely remember it being about the advantages of moving data out of the ILS. I only remember that because of ecorrado.\nAnother one where I don\u0026rsquo;t have slides for reminders. I believe he went over elearning content design, including SCORM, and the ability to have various representations of it. The representations would be inside desktop software, online courses, etc. There\u0026rsquo;s a big push in education for reusable learning objects so this is something to keep an eye on.\nThere were multiple breakout sessions but I went to the one on federated search interfaces. The general consensus in the room was that the current breed of solutions are terrible, if you can call them solutions. Most appear to be using SFX or similar. There was discussion about how much information to include, how to link things together, the problem with data from vendors, etc. There was also some loose discussion about interfaces to holdings in general similar to the lipstick on a pig session. Topics like tags came up which I\u0026rsquo;ll likely discuss on this site later. A takeaway point was that the vendors don\u0026rsquo;t supply all the data that would make this work best. It would be ideal to have the indexes on our end and then link to the content on their site. Supposedly Los Alamos was able to get this data from vendors though others have not had such luck. It was a good breakout session.\nThe lightning talks were all good though there were so many my memory is failing. Some standouts were Eric Hellman talking about security problems with many library systems, Charles Lockwood talking about making it easier to link to resources for faculty and Ross Singer\u0026rsquo;s talk on link resolver abstraction (router).\nThe bar of the evening was American Dream Pizza and Crowbar. The pizza was decent, the locals were friendly and the beer was great. I have to thank Eric Hellman for putting up with my OpenWorldCat complaints.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/03/code4lib2006-day-1-afternoon/","summary":"Continuing day 1 of the conference.Slides (ppt)This session was a list of many things you can do with your opac to make it a bit more useful.

I have to stress that this only gives you a small idea of the great information at this conference. The discussions at lunch and at the bar afterwards were just as informative and probably more so at time. I\u0026rsquo;ll be posting more soon.\nSlides (html)I was looking forward to this talk as I\u0026rsquo;ve followed the open-ils blogand think they are doing some interesting work, especially with the architecture (jabber, etc). The PINES consortia is a rather large state system. They found that the current vendor solutions did not meet their needs (wasn\u0026rsquo;t designed for it) and began development of their own. They hope to release it so other libraries/consortia can use it as well. The system was designed from the ground up without much of the \u0026ldquo;library-centric\u0026rdquo; backgrounds one might expect. Catalogers and others were asked for their ideal workflow rather than implement the current workarounds they used with other vendors.\nAnother interesting note is that they are storing marcxml in the database but when they want to display it or index it they transform it to MODS. They only go to the original marcxml record when they need something that is not contained within the MODS version. I believe they also stated they are using the PostgreSQL relevance ranking along with a few modifications.\nSlides (html)I\u0026rsquo;ve followed Art\u0026rsquo;s blogfor sometime as well and he\u0026rsquo;s got quite a few interesting projects, including using Google Desktop to search library holdings. I can\u0026rsquo;t say I understand much about the Acquisition side of libraries but the presentation still made sense. His main point seemed to be that ordering systems are very complex things with complex workflows and most ILS implementations are hacks or incomplete. Full-fledged ERP systems (non-library) would likely be a better investment and provide better workflows. Apparently quite a few libraries in Canada already do this.\nSlides (pdf)Since the conference this idea has taken off even more, but even then it was ramping up and I was interested in learning more. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been keeping as good of track as I should and don\u0026rsquo;t understand everything about it. My general understanding is that it is a simple microformat coupled with a simple API that allows you to move metadata for objects around. The official sitesays \u0026ldquo;unAPI is a tiny HTTP API for the few basic operations necessary to copy discrete, identified content from any kind of web application\u0026rdquo;. Your best bet is to go through the examples on the site. The one thing that is clear is that there is a need for the ability to copy/paste information on the web similar to copy/paste on the desktop. There\u0026rsquo;s also some posts by Jon Udelland over at Lesscodethat may bring you up to speed on the issue.\nSlides (pdf)This was another talk I was really looking forward to. If you\u0026rsquo;ve seen OpenWorldCat then you\u0026rsquo;ve seen some of the potential for WikiD. WikiD takes the potential of wiki\u0026rsquo;s and adds the potential of structured data. I also have written down that it incorporates ideas of OAI repositories as well. While this thing is way too advanced for anything I\u0026rsquo;d be playing with I got the definite impression that anyone working on digital library collections should be looking at this.\nThe whole data structure was interesting as well (if I understand it correctly). It can handle arbitrary xml schemas and it will store the data in that collection with that schema. For indexing it will use a uniform schema that you map your data to. There has also been a change apparently in SRU to allow updating. It seems like a nice example of using many of the standards that are out there (SRU/W, OpenURL, RSS, etc) and integrating them into a useful platform.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve probably just fed you with a bunch of misinformation so your best bet is to look through the slides, check out the project siteand an example site(use firefox).\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/03/code4lib2006-day-1-morning/","summary":"I should have posted this some time ago.

Our chat worked out fairly well except the new Opera preview appears to not support it. After that was over I asked edsu from #code4lib to join and got the screen above.\nMy first impression is that it is a hybrid of IM and IRC with a few helpful features thrown in. The ability to jump in at any time, leave chat rooms active, browse logs, etc, is a really nice addition. It\u0026rsquo;s also very simple to use. You can turn on guest access and then give the URL to people you want to join.\nAnother nice feature is that the accounts are only limited by number of users and space. You can create as many rooms as you want. I really see something like this being useful for small businesses or even just friends planning stuff. The obvious idea of virtual reference also comes up. A small library could easily use it for free. It would take a little bit to get a workflow but you could either start a seperate room for each person or when a person joins, lock the room so it\u0026rsquo;s off-record and others can\u0026rsquo;t enter. Once a patron leaves, reopen it so others can join. Sure beats some of the giant java based junk that\u0026rsquo;s out there. IM though is probably just as good an option if not better. If you library happens to block such things or it would take too much training, this may be an option to look at.\nFor a better idea of what it is and what it does:\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/03/campfire-chat/","summary":"Attempting to do a group IM today with some friends turned sour due to client incompatibilies and other problems.

During code4lib2006 I got the chance to drink and complain with Eric Hellman of Openly/OCLC. Since I\u0026rsquo;m more of a patron most of my complaints were about OpenWorldCat. One of my criticisms was that it was so hard to search. If you go to worldcatlibraries.orgthen you get a nice vendor page for the product. If you go to worldcat.orgyou get a login screen. As far as I know there is no easy to remember site that I can plug into my browser and easily search OpenWorldCat. Once your on a record within it you can easily search and they do have a \u0026ldquo;demo\u0026rdquo; pagebut that\u0026rsquo;s not the easiest to find.\nI\u0026rsquo;d really like to see the demo page cleaned up a bit and put at some memorable url. OCLC has been steadily improving so this may be in the works. It is possible, however, for your library to include a simple search box in a page that will fire off a search to a search engine and limit to OpenWorldCat results. Your probably asking yourself what value this has when the person is already on your library site. The first is that it advertises the service which the patron may find useful in the future if they are trying to find a book you don\u0026rsquo;t have or a specific edition. It\u0026rsquo;s also helpful for those who may have some problems searching the OPAC. OpenWorldCat doesn\u0026rsquo;t have your entire catalog most likely but it could be the thing that prevents them from giving up and going to Amazon.\nSince both Yahoo and Google have search API\u0026rsquo;s there is the option of actually including the results into your own applications.

Unfortunately I\u0026rsquo;m not graced with SuperCatwith such things like a bookbag api so I have to work with III url\u0026rsquo;s which aren\u0026rsquo;t pretty. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently been requesting quite a few books through our union catalog and wondered if there was a way to easily link to the request pages. My ideal would be to set-up something similar to a netflix queue where I could easily request the next book on my list. I can link to the record pages and then click to request it but a couple less clicks would be nice.\nFor various other reasons that probably won\u0026rsquo;t be possible with the union catalog without more work but in the process I figured out what appears to be a reusable URL structure for requests based on bib/record numbers. These URLs will take you to the request page where you enter your information or pick a location, etc. Someone else may be able to figure out how to enter your information, though be careful about how you pass PIN/passwords if required.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s a sample URL:\nhttp://youropac/search/.b1341013//1,1,1,B/request~b1341013\nFor some reason you have to repeat the bib number 2 times. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried simpler combinations of the above and haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to simplify it much without breaking it. You can also include characters between the // which is what III does but it appears to work without it. You do need the extra slash though to prevent a 404. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example with all 3 bibs:\nhttp://youropac/search/.b1341013/b1341013/1,1,1,B/request~b1341013\nFrom what I can tell this does a search for the bib and then goes to the request. I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to get it to work by going straight to the bibrecord with record=.\nRegardless this comes in handy if your using the III XMLOpac and want to generate links for requests. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example using Cal State\u0026rsquo;s XML Opac. Casey has also added links in his WPOpac(in link list on right hand side of a record).

I haven\u0026rsquo;t posted much specifically about it compared to others but managed to be quoted in iy. Unfortunately it looks like my posts were misunderstood. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much of this is to blame on my writing skillz as there has been previous misunderstandings with my posts. I figured I might as well respond with what I hope is clearer.\nThe first thing Walt goes into is my Hiding Complexity post. I was surpised to see it cited as a post \u0026ldquo;about potential difficulties with a more open architecture\u0026rdquo;. I actually opened the post with \u0026ldquo;One of the benefits of a more open architecture\u0026rdquo; but maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t back that up with the rest of the post. My hope was to show that having an open architecture would allow libraries to customize the interface to their needs, making it as complex or as simple as needed for the application. Currently in some systems you can tweak templates and remove icons but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a robust system that can really push the customization.\nThe next part was that my post may have suggested that privacy didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. That is far from what I hoped to convey and is the opposite of what I believe. I do think libraries make tradeoffs though. If your keeping records of what people have checked out then your trading some privacy as the price of business. There are libraries now that you can just do a cash deposit to check out the bookbut that is far from the norm. If your library offers book clubs that have people read the same book then there is another privacy issue. If I know how long someone has been in the club and what books the club has read then I can probably tell what that person has been reading, even without the library keeping a patron history. But the fact of the matter is that the person has given up this privacy probably because they WANT to share what they are reading with others. The same goes for RSS of reading lists. I used to have my reading list on this site (coming back soon after some site work) because I liked the idea of showing what I was reading. Telling someone that they can\u0026rsquo;t use RSS to show their book list due to privacy I think would be the same as telling someone they can\u0026rsquo;t join a bookclub or tell anyone they\u0026rsquo;re apart of it.\nMany of the services out there have a trade-off with privacy. Some will want to make the trade-off for the service, some will not. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is the same as saying privacy doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. I think it is the service provider\u0026rsquo;s job to make sure that the user is aware of the privacy and security issues involved. If you offer RSS feeds you should make sure the people who OPT-IN know what they are getting. If you offer patron history and recommendations then they should know what could happen, especially in this age of Patriot Act. I chose to turn on Google Search History and I knew that I was giving up some privacy. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say I don\u0026rsquo;t care about my privacy, because I do. I want to stress that I think such services should be opt-in and I believe libraries such as AADL are doing a decent job of that so far.\nThe final portion of my section is in regards to my Talis response. I\u0026rsquo;m still a bit confused by what Talis sees as their ideal and the library\u0026rsquo;s place in it. Regardless Walt brings up that there are no real-world solutions made by non-vendor developers.

Both sites were loaded using lynx. Gmail completely failed to load while Backpack was still quite usable. I also tried to load the mobile gmail in lynx and it seemed to choke on the mime-type. Of course something like this is applicable not just for lynx users but also for things such as text-to-speech/screenreaders, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s always nice to think about how well your application will work when people access it with less then optimal set-ups.

While many probably see parallels between Squidoo and subject guides, I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about community involvement. An example of an applicable Squidoo would be this one for Harvard Square. Many local governments already have attractions, tourist and \u0026ldquo;why to move here\u0026rdquo; pages, but how many are community driven?\nAs you probably know AADL already has a community photo project. I think this could be extended to have pages about community locations or even pages by people about what you MUST SEE when you come there. Who do you trust more than the locals? They most likely already have community photos of many of the destinations. Again I picked AADL because I believe their Drupal backend will likely make this possible. Presuming the data is accessible in some sort of feed then local goverments or other community sites could pull them in. A great way of showcasing the community while getting people involved in your library.\nPlenty of other ideas but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave this one where it stands.

It also helps if you want to create your own protocols for testing/development, etc.\nBy protocol what I mean is the URL prefix such as aim:// mailto:// etc. Usually when you install a program that uses it\u0026rsquo;s own protocol prefix it will update your browser with the correct information. On linux and OSX though I\u0026rsquo;ve had mixed results and sometimes I want to send the information to other programs such as mplayer or VLC even on Windows. My original problem was with the Last.fm service whose radio player uses the lastfm:// protocol.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t already know you can type about:config into the address bar in Firefox and get advanced settings. This allows you to highly tweak the browser if you wish. It also allows you to add custom settings which is what we need to do. The general layout is:\nnetwork.protocol-handler.external.protocol = boolean (true or false) network.protocol-handler.app.protocol = /path/to/program\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found that there is no need to do the external boolean in my testing just the app one. So to add the lastfm:// protocol you would go to about:config and then right-click somewhere and choose new \u0026gt; string. You would then enter the following information:\nPreference Name: network.protocol-handler.app.lastfm Value: /path/to/lasfm/player (/home/ebyryan/Downloads/lastfm/player in my case)\nFor windows it would likely be the \u0026ldquo;C:\\dir\\to\\file\u0026rdquo; structure while OSX would have similar syntax to above (try terminal). You will likely need to restart firefox to notice the change. I\u0026rsquo;ve also used this to handle iTunes (itmss) protocols.

Art could also benefit.\nFor those libraries with audio/visual holdings that you may want to offer this could be a possible way to do so. Offer a download that gives text and images of an event along with relevant sounds. An experience some would get from a website though now it is more portable.

In some of the discussions about Library2.0/OPAC2.0 I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people create lists of \u0026ldquo;cool technologies\u0026rdquo; that more or less included everything they used. While these technologies are all great it\u0026rsquo;s prudent to step back and think about their usefullness in the context of a library. While I use gmail, my library providing a multi-gig email service would most likely be a waste of time and resources that could be spent better elsewhere.\nI was impressed to see that Michael Stephens start out one of his presentations(pdf) with a similar discussion. He has a corresponding article over at Library Journal. (via TameTheWeb)\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m very pro-technology, specifically in it\u0026rsquo;s use in education, I believe it\u0026rsquo;s very important to step back and ask yourself if this technology can help you accomplish a mission or goal and be worth the time and investment. As others have stated blogs and rss have many benefits and little risk. With the multitude of free services out there I can think of almost no reason for someone to at least try it out.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider another \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; service though, Flickr. While I think it\u0026rsquo;s a great service I\u0026rsquo;d have to think harder about how it would be worthwhile to create a seperate social photo sharing service for patrons. One such possibility would be to host a gallery of local photos for the community. The AADLhas done something similar in their pictureAnnArbor project. It\u0026rsquo;s important to point out that this is not a Flickr clone but instead a photo gallery system that is used as a way to connect with the community. They even use it to pull in people for in-library \u0026ldquo;scanning sessions\u0026rdquo;. A resource that may come in handy for prospective visitors or residents of the area. A far cry from just throwing up a photo service and seeing what happens. I can think of many more ways this could have been done wrong then right. There was some obvious thought put in.\nBack to internet and email. My old librarywas one of the first in the community to offer internet and email (was Pine/text only first and then web once it started catching on). They still offer both for free for the community which I think is thanks to the fact that Michigan has the Merit Network. I also get free dialup via Merit from my University. If this was beginning today I would have to say offering free email wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the best idea to spend resources and money on, especially if your just cloning some other service. The free dial-up is a nice service, especially for low-income users but it\u0026rsquo;s helped by the fact that someone runs the modem pools. If the library had to run their own modem pools, etc I would probably highly discourage it.\nBefore the rambling goes on too long I\u0026rsquo;ll just drive the points home. Think of technology in context of a mission or goal, not a goal/mission in the context of the technology. Some of us would be happy finding books. ;-)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a nice post titled \u0026ldquo;Library 2.0 Perils\u0026rdquo; over at Blyberg.netthat\u0026rsquo;s worth a read.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2005/11/library-2.0-a-tool-or-just-cool/","summary":"While I have some more indepth ideas brewing for articles over at libdev I thought this one deserved to be posted now.

This left a void in actual search that many people wanted, which Google filled. When I got home (was reading at the laundromat) and checked my aggregator I came across this:\nI think this is true for many endeavors, not just companies. Sometimes re-branding can get you by for awhile and sometimes you have to make more drastic changes to stay afloat. It seems many in the library world are afraid of such drastic changes and I wonder how it will all pan out.\nMore updates regarding the book as I get around to reading it, which will be within the next month as to avoid over due fines ;-)\nNote for OpenWorldCat: Since you have nice link URLs availableit would be good to have a permalink available in the record so it can easily be linked to (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find one at least).

Two recent examples are Yahoo Traveland the new Yahoo Maps. Yahoo Travel takes advantage of user ratings, user pictures, weather along with many other services. The big surprise is that all the information looks like it belongs and really helps the experience. In the old yahoo I remember it would have likely been links to canned searches in the other services, etc. Very nice work now. The new maps is a similar story using local information, traffic reports, etc. They also released API\u0026rsquo;s for each individual service which makes me almost think there are backend changes going on to allow this sudden change in integration.\nThis reminds me a lot of the current online presence of many libraries. A library homepage here, OPAC there, electronic resources somewhere, etc. The services are disjointed and become confusing. I deal with quite a few patrons that just don\u0026rsquo;t know where to look and I don\u0026rsquo;t blame them. This landscape is changing though as more and more vendors come out with decent APIs and backends or someone hacks a way around limitations. I\u0026rsquo;m liking what I see in many redesigns and hope for more improvement in the future. Getting something seamless though will likely require a large undertaking and perhaps a complete backend rehaul.

The patrons PIN and barcode were included in the feed (URL I believe). This was a mistake due to the fact that some people use web based aggregators that allow others to see their feeds. It\u0026rsquo;s good to see that SPL recognized the problems and corrected it but it highlights a few areas that need to be considered when implementing services such as this.\nOne is user education. This is a new technology for many people and so they may not realize the consequences of making the data available. I use a few sites that have private feeds and they are covered in warnings about being careful about the feeds. With the increase in phishing and other problems I don\u0026rsquo;t really think there is any technology where you can presume the user knows. What I\u0026rsquo;ve see done for feeds is that it is marked with a lengthy random key for a URL and the user can have the key/url regenerated if they believe it has been compromised. There is also a possibility of authentication though I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain of the support. Of course, non of this will prevent someone from using a third party site that may show their information so it is still best to have as little personal identity information in there as possible.\nAnother is privacy in general. You may be able to create great services by collecting as much data as you can and keeping the data but you need to be clear about what you are doing so patrons can make the choice. Some will want to have their data available as LibraryElfhas shown but others would likely prefer to not have their history on file, especially with the recent library vs. feds/PATRIOT stuff going on. I believe it would be best to support both and have the data collection be an opt-in but right now I doubt few systems support conditional collection.\nLibraries are obviously not the only ones making this mistake but it\u0026rsquo;s important to pay attention to these issues. A privacy policy is nice but take the time to think about what data is needed and what isn\u0026rsquo;t and where this data may end up.\nIf I sound critical it is because I\u0026rsquo;ve had three departments in our college notify me in the last year that my information was compromised. Most of these units had no reason to have that sort of information on file. My University seems to be getting a clue now about security but I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s plenty out there that haven\u0026rsquo;t.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2005/10/library-service-security-and-privacy/","summary":"There was a recent post over at TechnoBiblioregarding a recent security problemwith the SPL RSS feeds.

One of the things that bothers me is the lack of more meaningful data in many of the records. This is changing as table of contents are now regularly entered but there is still alot of old materials that have not been.\nRight now it seems like some libraries, mine included, think that linking to a table of contents is a solution. This helps some but presumes I\u0026rsquo;ve already found the work. As a science student many of the research works are anthologies, collected papers or books with whimsical names. This often means that I have to hope that I chose keywords in the subject or keywords chosen by the cataloger. This isn\u0026rsquo;t always the case depending on how specialized a resource I\u0026rsquo;m looking for and isn\u0026rsquo;t the catalogers fault. Having the table of contents at a minimum and more data if possible helps alot in finding what I need. This is why I often look for other sites to search to start getting ideas and then use the catalog to see if we carry it. Worst case scenario I look for books that are in the general area of what I want (but not actually what I want) and try to find call number areas to browse.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll end the rant here but you can read the old post for more.

The article he links tohas quite a few good recommendations. I\u0026rsquo;ll address one of the quotes on TtW first:\nAlone, this statement is rather misleading but was used great in the article to push the use of RSS elsewhere. RSS does not need a blog and blogs don\u0026rsquo;t have to have RSS. Blogs make it easier to create RSS feeds and allow the ability of having a dedicated site. However, if you want to just create RSS feeds so that people can pull in content to the library homepage, courseware, etc there are desktop tools you can use to create the RSS files. It\u0026rsquo;s often simpler to just use a free blog service though some people may find it easier to use a desktop product or prefer not to have a separate site. Some example software (I haven\u0026rsquo;t used so no recommendations):\nAlso tying the value of the blog with the value of the feed is also a bit pushing it. There are plenty of people who actually visit a blog to read it and not subscribe to the feed. I read too many sites to actually visit them. Also the survey results aren\u0026rsquo;t surprising in light of other surveys out there. For example these two:\nDespite this, RSS has the ability to really bring information to people even if they aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of it. Having the ability to put timely, relevant information into courses, portals, anywhere is a boon. And this can be anything including events, announcements, etc. Our university uses RSS for their system status alerts so that the information can be syndicated on sites that need to let their users know. Mail server going down for emergency maintenance? A single update puts the information everywhere it needs to be. I currently pull the alerts in to our intranet and a portal instance as we handle the calls when there\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\nThe article recommends the use of RSS2JS services and I have to agree. I\u0026rsquo;ve used it on various sites (portal) due to the fact that server-side parsing was not available. I still prefer to do the parsing myself with MagpieRSSso I don\u0026rsquo;t depend on external services or javascript support but that\u0026rsquo;s not always possible. The code is available for many of the JS converters so you if you can find a server to host it on then you can rest easier. Here are a few of the services out there:\nIf you go to the more section of the first Feed2JSthere is a list of alternate services though many are ad supported. A google search for rss2js or feed2js may find more.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written a similar parser for podcasts and have been experimenting with pulling those into courses. If I get anything that\u0026rsquo;s not alpha quality I\u0026rsquo;ll try to post it.\nI guess that the take away message, as it is in the article, is to not write-off the blog just because only a few people visit it.

The only thing I really buy offline is food and if I lived in an area large enough to have online groceries, I would certainly buy them online too. There is just too much convenience and I just hate the offline shopping experience. There are occasions that I like seeing something in person but I usually then go home and buy it online once I\u0026rsquo;ve made the decision. Usually I base my decisions on what people say in blogs, amazon, etc. I never try clothes on so there is really no reason for me to go shopping.\nWhat I do hate is getting shit delivered once I buy it. As someone that works evenings (4pm to Midnight) I find that the services are not set-up to work with me. Actually my schedule probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, the services just suck. I\u0026rsquo;d get my packages delivered to work but for obvious liability reasons that is not allowed. Luckily I live in an apartment complex so I have an office that will sign for packages. Or at least they would if the assholes would leave it there.\nFedEx has apparently adapted to people working 8-4/9-5 by showing up at my door at 7am. As someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t usually hit the sack until 2-3am this is inconvenient. I assure you I am not getting out of bed for anything at 7am. I don\u0026rsquo;t care if it\u0026rsquo;s Ed McMahon with a check. They also will not leave a package that has to be signed with the office. This means if I want my package I need to pick it up myself. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a signature then they just whip it at my door, which is also unfortunate as my door is right by everyone\u0026rsquo;s mailboxes. Packages have disappeared. There is also no protection from the weather.\nI refuse to sign any sheets for FedEx as both times I did they gave me a package that was supposed to be delivered to somewhere in Asia, then argued that I had signed for it and it was, therefore, my responsibility and I was liable. I assure you this did not hold forever but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go through the experience again.\nI will give them credit for coming back later in the day one time. I worker appeared to be new and still learning so I\u0026rsquo;m sure that won\u0026rsquo;t happen again.\nUPS appears to take the opposite approach for the workday and shows up between 4-5 which is when I\u0026rsquo;m starting my workshift. Luckily, if I leave a note, they usually will leave it at the office. Unfortunately, the office closes at 6 so it\u0026rsquo;s hit or miss whether they get over there in time.\nThis would be my preferred service but my packages seem to disappear off the face of the earth too often. Usually they appear to be signed for in Texas. I have suspicions that these mis-deliveries aren\u0026rsquo;t accidental but I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to collect evidence. Also, Amazon is awesome with it\u0026rsquo;s replacements. Overall I\u0026rsquo;m OK with the UPS service as they will at least deliver the package, if not always to me.\nDespite how many people seem to dislike the mail service, I still prefer them as my delivery though not much more than UPS. The driver comes at around the same time each day (noon-1pm) which is a good time for me and will leave it with the office if need be unless some special signature stuff was asked for. Usually if I authorize it though they will leave it. They do have the problem with leaving packages next to my door if no signature proof is required though. They also tend to do more attempts and have a convenient location in the odd chance I need to pick it up. FedEx and UPS have their centers way the hell out of town.\nI bring this up because I just bought some books from Amazonand of course got the uneasy feeling in my stomach anticipating what hell I would be going through to get my order but alas it came through USPS and I got them without much trouble at all. They were left at my door again though. Amazon boxes are a tad too easy to pick out and I can see someone grabbing it thinking it was DVD\u0026rsquo;s etc. Oh well.\nBTW, the books I got were Anansi Boysby my favorite author Neil Gaimanand Freakonomics. I already had the audiobook from iTunes but one of the authors is coming to townand thought I\u0026rsquo;d get something signed. The authors also have a blog.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2005/10/delivery-services-the-only-thing-i-hate-about-shopping-online/","summary":"I love shopping online.

It\u0026rsquo;s been updated to stated that it has a Wiki backend and supports Wiki Markup though I don\u0026rsquo;t see either of those either. For this review I will presume there is absolutely nothing Wiki-related and focus on other things.\nThe first thing I noticed was that I was required to login to add content. This makes sense and I was happy to see that I could login with my WebJunction information. FirstSearch usernames are also allowed which works since only libraries that subscribe to FirstSearch are in OpenWorldCat now, or so it says on the homepage.\nOverall the interface is clean and easy to use and the features are nice. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that my library appears to have holdings covered in it, so it may be more useful for me that others. Having said that I think there are plenty of areas where it could grow and here\u0026rsquo;s some of my ideas for reference.\nIANAL: I am not a librarian. I am looking at this as an outsider. What some call \u0026ldquo;a patron\u0026rdquo;. As such I have no real idea the politics, service agreements, purpose or otherwise behind WorldCat or more specifically OpenWorldCat. What I list below may not be feasible or go against the purpose of said project. Won\u0026rsquo;t stop be from spewing opinions though.\nI guess as it stands it seems like a nice service but I don\u0026rsquo;t really see the point of using yet. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s nice if someone searches for a book title in a search engine they get the option of searching in a library, but it seems like a waste of such a large undertaking for just that. Hopefully they have plenty of things cooking for the future. But if they are going to try to add these features they should really try to make the service more public and easier to access or I don\u0026rsquo;t think it will take off.\nUpdate: There\u0026rsquo;s a post at Outgoingthat goes over the wiki capabilities.

I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is right as it\u0026rsquo;s using other people\u0026rsquo;s content to push their own service, and some probably have copyrights that probably forbid this.

As you may know I recently started using Gregarius, and the SVN version thereof. Subversionwas fairly easy for me to pick up and had some very useful features. Since I had subversion installed I went ahead and created my own repository for my projects.\nI had planned to do similar quite awhile ago after reading a series of articles on managing web projects. I recommend giving them a read:\nSubversion itself is useful, but add-on Tracand it\u0026rsquo;s wonderful. At first I doubted whether this would even be worth it. Being a one man shop and doing internal projects made me think that just coding it would be enough. Version control was something for large, distributed projects. Using Trac at the Gregarius site and seeing the review at 0xDecafbadconvinced me to give it a whirl. It did take a little bit to get used to but it\u0026rsquo;s already coming in handy. Being able to run a simple command and seeing what I\u0026rsquo;ve changed is more helpful then I thought. I can now run my dev version and create patches for the live version with ease instead of overwriting it like I used to. If I happen to screw something up I can easily go back to whatever version I need.\nTrac itself has a ticket system, wiki and nice tracking features (timeline, etc.). Again I thought this as overkill as how many bugs I find would be minimal, but the documentation gave the idea of using it to track everything about the project. I now use the ticket system to track what features I want along with bugs and the like. I assign the features to milestones/versions and assign a priority. It lets me easily see what features I want and how they are fairing. I can easily re-prioritize things and keep track of the big picture. I\u0026rsquo;ve only had it going for a few days but it\u0026rsquo;s already working well for me.\nI have my install behind authentication due to the projects being work/internal.

One of the great things about podcasts is the ability to \u0026ldquo;set it and forget it\u0026rdquo; as Ronco would say. Some have a regular schedule but things that are season-based can be more troublesome to keep up on. You can subscribe to their mailing list but I try to keep my email subscriptions to a minimum. A caveat: the mp3\u0026rsquo;s are only available until the next episode comes out (podcasting is still in trial phase) otherwise you have to stream realplayer. You can dump the real stream to mp3 using mplayerif need be but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that to you.\nOn a related note the Web Essentials 2005 Podcasts are up(some link to slides too). Tons of great presentations and the quality is great. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of conferences that post audio and preferably slides of their presentations. ITConversationsis a godsend, especially for someone that can\u0026rsquo;t afford to go to these conferences. The Duke Podcasting Symposium has webcasts up now of sessionsas well.\nUnfortunately the library conferences, even the tech ones, seem to lag behind. The conference sites themselves are often confusing and there is no central place where people post their slides, etc. Some organizations even have them behind a authentication scheme where you have to be a member to get them. The recent Chicago ALA Wikiwas a breath of fresh air though that was more grassroots than officially ordained.

They also weren\u0026rsquo;t very nice to look at though the data was comprehensive. Eventually a program called ShortStatcame out and I switched to that. It gave me the basic information I needed without all the fluff and was in a easy to read/use format.\nWell the successor, Mint, came out recently and I went ahead and bought it. My site gets little traffic (100 hits a week or so) so the $30 price tag was a bit high for me. On the other hand I was tempted many times to make a donation for ShortStat so I think of it as a split purchase. Either way I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with the results. It has everything I liked about ShortStat with addition of so much more. By much more I don\u0026rsquo;t mean as much as AWStats, etc though you can practically make it that much if you want to using Pepperadd-ons. More about those later.\nThe first big improvement I like is the fix for referrer spam. My ShortStat was plagued by referrer spam as was everything else I\u0026rsquo;ve tried. Mint uses javascript to help weed out some of the robots. I\u0026rsquo;m sure someone will make a robot that can parse javascript but for now it works great. The various levels of display for referrers (repeat, recent, unique) are also helpful. The downside of this protection is I don\u0026rsquo;t see people accessing the site with javascript turned off but that\u0026rsquo;s not a biggie for me.\nThe next thing I like are the search displays. I get an easy view of what searches are leading to my site and what searches people perform at my site. The latter is a very nice addition and is split into common and most recent as is the other. A plus is that it works with Wordpress without doing any changes to Wordpress. I just entered a \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;s' in the Pepper config and off it went.\nAnd then there are the Pepper add-ons. Right now I only have one installed which is outclicks. This tracks what links people are clicking on to leave my site. I plan on installing the error tracker onein the near future as error pages was originally why I ran the larger stat programs. With the addition of that I think I will have pretty much everything I want and no more. I can disable modules at will if I please so I only have what I want.\nAn additional plus, for me at least, is that the default doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to track IP addresses, though there is a Pepper to do so.Update: While moving mint to my new domain I took a look at the database and it does indeed track IP\u0026rsquo;s. Oh Well.This is a plus as (supposedly) our library has a policy of not logging information for our websites that may contain IP addresses as part of our policy. I question if this is actually the case but as someone in a department I only have access to hit counts and no other information. This makes it difficult to plan redesigns, etc as I have no information on what people are using to access the site or what they are doing at the site. I may be talking to some people to see if I can get some minty goodness going and still stay in our privacy policy.\nOverall I say this product was worth every cent and I use it many times a day. If you are looking for a simple stats program that gives you what you want and only what you want then give it a try. Below is a screenshot of part of my set-up. The thumbnail links to a full-sized image which is rather large (1234x822 180k).\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2005/09/mint-some-tasty-stats/","summary":"I used to use various stat programs such as AWStats, Webalizer, etc but they were just overkill for what I needed.

I could care less about WMA support and would prefer they don\u0026rsquo;t as I\u0026rsquo;m in the camp that belives that codec should be put to rest.\nA nice story I came across today though is that of Fox responding to fan complaints about the DRM in the online only FireFly soundtrack by releasing mp3 versionsto those who bought it. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen Firefly but was tempted to purchase the soundtrack just because of this gutsy move. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to see a media outlet do such a thing.

I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to post about it but since I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the study itself crop up on some library blogs I\u0026rsquo;d thought I\u0026rsquo;d link to it so there there\u0026rsquo;s at least a counter-point (not that many people read this blog).","title":"Accessible Audiobooks, DRM and Consumer Voice"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve seen various posts on the internet regarding higher education podcasts, including lectures. Came across one on diggtoday about a University of Michigan department actually offering private podcasts through the iTunes music store to students. They state it\u0026rsquo;s a partnership with Apple. An interesting development and I think a slightly better partnership than the Napster shit some colleges are doing. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested in seeing how much piracy that supposedly prevents but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that for another day. Partnering to offer actual content from the university is a nice step. I\u0026rsquo;d prefer it be open to all but know that many professors and universities are yet to that stage of openness.

If you are looking for Debian tools such as apt-get for OSX then you probably want Fink. If you are looking for Gentoo/portage for OSX then you\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to take a look at this how-to at the Gentoo Wiki.\nSince I\u0026rsquo;ve reviewed some other things I thought I\u0026rsquo;d go over the systems I use, not that anyone would care. Here they are anyways with some mini-reviews of each.\nWhile Gentoocan be a bit more difficult to install that some distros(I believe they are working on an installer), the amount of tweaking and customization it allows is amazing. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to have the entire system compiled from source so that it is optimized for your hardware. I\u0026rsquo;m personnally still a newb when it comes to linux and cringe at the idea of compiling something from scratch, but the emerge/portage system makes this so easy I think it\u0026rsquo;s really a great distro even for a newb. Optimizing and tweaking does require some know-how.\nThe real winner here is how much documentation they have online. The Online Handbookcoupled with the Gentoo Forumsis pretty much all you will ever need. I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to have a question that wasn\u0026rsquo;t answered somewhere in there. It\u0026rsquo;s these kind of resources that really make the product and other distros should take note. If you got a spare harddrive or computer then give it a whirl.\nAs for desktop environments I\u0026rsquo;m currently using Gnome, though I\u0026rsquo;ve used KDEin the past. It\u0026rsquo;s rather easy to switch so I might do so in the future depending on what come\u0026rsquo;s out. One of the joys of using Linux is choice, though this can be a hinderance to some as they don\u0026rsquo;t know what to choose.\nAs a side note I find that CrossOver Officeruns pretty much all the Windows applications I\u0026rsquo;m still stuck using here at work including Office 2000/XP (2003 not yet supported).\nWell I caught the Apple bug after I purchased an iPod back in 2002 and soon purchased an iBook. I\u0026rsquo;ve been very happy ever since. As far as desktop environments go I don\u0026rsquo;t think anything comes close to OSX. Gnome and KDE are great and are getting better, but I\u0026rsquo;m still the happiest with OSX. Yes, there\u0026rsquo;s unneeded eye candy, like WinXP but unlike WinXP it actually runs decently and I\u0026rsquo;ve found that each new release actually runs better on the same hardware! The first thing I do when I\u0026rsquo;m at a WinXP station is turn off all the eyecandy, though I prefer to find a station that still has Win2k on it.\nOverall it just works, the applications available are great and if I need a bit more control there are still BSD underpinnings. This comes in handy when you administer linux servers, which brings me to..\nWhile Gentoo is great, especially if you want bleeding edge, there\u0026rsquo;s something about the stability of Debianthat keeps me using it. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my server running for at least 3 or 4 years now without a crash or problem. The only downtime I\u0026rsquo;ve had is upgrading kernels and the occasional act of god (power outage, powersupply failure, etc). The ease of updating with apt is probably the killer feature. I have to say of the distro\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, the easiest to maintain for servers has to be Debian. If you want to run a small development box or host your website or whatever, I highly recommend giving it a try. I run mine on a old 400Mhz P2 and it hasn\u0026rsquo;t let me down yet.\nYour mileage may vary with the above but they\u0026rsquo;re the ones I\u0026rsquo;m sticking with.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2005/09/my-os-gentoo-debian-osx-tiger/","summary":"Update: Noticed some searches coming to this post.

I had presumed that the data had been backed up by those running the server. No more. I\u0026rsquo;ve been slowly implementing backup procedures for the various servers my department has data on. Still got a lot of work to do.\nWell two days ago another server crashed (hdd failure) and, big surprise, the supposed backups failed. Luckily I had a copy of our stuff to put back up. The other departments\u0026hellip;probably not as lucky. I house my backups on my server (this one) and thought to myself, damn I better make sure everything is backed up onto a third computer. I also better make sure that the blog and sites and everything are currently backed up.\nWell long story short I went to backup this site and bam, hard drive failure. At least I thought so as there were DMA timeout errors. It ended up being a bad cable from the power supply. Switched cables and ebybox is back in business. What amazes me is that ebybox is around 7 or 8 years old (400Mhz P2) and still running on the original hardware, including harddrives. This was a computer I put together myself so it has a bit better hardware than some.\nMy friends? Not so lucky as they have mostly newer harddrives which seem to drop like flies every few months. It used to be that there were certain brands you could trust but now adays it seems your gambling when you choose a drive and if your lucky it\u0026rsquo;ll last. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to upgrade the drives in my server as I just don\u0026rsquo;t trust any of the current ones out there (unless you drop some big moolah for enterprise level drives). I\u0026rsquo;m all for increasing capacity but at least make it so I can trust putting shit on the thing. My friend had 3 large drives in a RAID and they all went at once. Kind of hard to recover data from that.\nWell the lesson here is back shit up. Not only that but do it to different computers. I may be looking at Strongspacehere in the future once we start putting more critical operations online. I apologize for the downtime. There may be more in the future if I end up having to replace the power supply.\nUpdate: A timely article at Mezzoblue.

As my job changed and I was switching between work and home computers I found it problematic to have it at only one location. Eventually the web-based aggregators matured and I signed up at bloglines. I was very happy with the service but prefer to host things myself if possible so I have more control and can tweak things to work the way I want. Having the search/data local is also a plus as I found the bloglines search not working well for me.\nI can finally do this thanks to Gregarius. The default layout is very bloglines-ish which is nice and it tends to work much better than bloglines itself. I was having a lot of problems with bloglines lately with their javascript based feed list. It\u0026rsquo;s also themeable so I can tweak things as I like. The features and feed updating are great and it easily handles my 300+ feeds with ease.\nThe product alone isn\u0026rsquo;t why I\u0026rsquo;m recommending it, but instead the development side of things. The first install of the program was not fun as it used php short tags which I have disabled (do alot of xml work). This forced me to search and replace through many files and was sometimes hard to track down. Once I got it working I went ahead and checked out the dev site and saw that some of the tags were fixed. I reopened the ticket to have the short echo tags updated and I\u0026rsquo;d say it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a day or two later that it was fixed. I now run the SVN version of it and love it.\nI still haven\u0026rsquo;t had time to tweak the theme how I want but if you are looking for a aggregator for either yourself or work then give Gregarius a whirl. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;ll be disappointed. I highly recommend checking out the SVN version or downloading a nightly as there are plenty of fixes and it still seems to work great.\nBTW. If you are only tracking a few feeds you may prefer lilina.

I first began with creating html views of featured lists. Once I had the syntax down I created RSS 2.0 feeds for the lists. While I was doing this I came across a post over at open-ilsthat referred to OpenSearch. I had done a little with OpenSearchwhen it first came out but not since I started playing with the XML server. BTW, I recommend reading the whole post over at open-ils. Lots of great thinking in it.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the end product: http://a9.com/harry%20potter?a=sB0007WF86MYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that right now I only have the title and availabilities. This is because it was a quick mock-up and I wanted to make things a bit quicker (why in a future post). You can really add any data from the XML output by modifying the XSL file for the description. I find this is really easy to read though I really should add the pub date and call number. A special note as well: certain resources didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have a call number (thesis I think) so I chose to link to the OPAC by bib number. This also is a time saver as it is returned in the basic XML result.\nFirst you\u0026rsquo;ll need something server-side that can transform xml. I prefer to use php5 as these things are really simple in it. What you\u0026rsquo;ll do is take arguments on the URL and then create a xml server query using it. For example here is a sample OpenSearch URL:\nopensearch.php?q=harry%20potter\u0026amp;p=1\u0026amp;c=10This sets the query to be \u0026ldquo;harry potter\u0026rdquo;, the first page of results and 10 titles returned. The resulting xml server query would be:\npath.to.xmlopac/.$term.\u0026quot;/0/0/\u0026quot;.$page.\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;.$count.\u0026quot;?avsrank=D\u0026amp;noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD\u0026amp;exclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD.VARFLDPRIMARYALTERNATEPAIRA quick runthrough of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. The $term is actually the query from the URL with a \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; put in front of it to signify that it is keyword. I could just put the X right in the url line but remember I\u0026rsquo;m reusing this from my RSS work which actually allows you to choose what kind of search. Page and count are simlar except where I have page is actually the result number. I do some arithmetic behind the scenes so page 2 starts at result 11. I know this is confusing and opensearch supports passing result number but again with was something I reused from before.\nOnce you have the URL you will want to apply XSLT to it. Here\u0026rsquo;s the full template to transform your XML result into OpenSearch:\nXSL File(you may need to view source as I don\u0026rsquo;t have all my mimetypes set)\nYou then need to make your script return the resulting feed. In my case I just echo\u0026rsquo;d the result. There\u0026rsquo;s an additional file you need to create to describe your opensearch interface which is outlined at the OpenSearch site. My explanation is probably bad so here are the 3 files you need:\nI\u0026rsquo;m learning as I go so feel free to offer suggestions on coding, but please don\u0026rsquo;t mock.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2005/07/innovative-xml-server-opensearch/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on various ideas for using our Innovative XML server.

I can\u0026rsquo;t say it much better than it\u0026rsquo;s covered here:\nhttp://daringfireball.net/2005/06/shufflingI tried many mp3 players before I bought the iPod and every single one left me wanting. The Creative interface sucks. You have to work to listen to music and there\u0026rsquo;s some many options that it really is more time consuming then it\u0026rsquo;s worth. The iPod has such a simple interface that I almost never have to look at the interface it self. The only time I look at it these days is to see what song is playing or if I can\u0026rsquo;t remember what playlists are on it. I usually just use shuffle mode now.\nI would love to have features, such as Ogg support, but when I try out the players that support them I just want to throw them away. I encouraged anyone in the market for a new player to try out the various players. I think you\u0026rsquo;ll agree that the iPod\u0026rsquo;s interface is worth the extra money and the less features. I just tried some of the new ones and if I get a new mp3 player I think it will be an iPod again.\nThe iPod is also the reason I have the iBook I\u0026rsquo;m on right now.

I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to create an OpenSearch module and RSS output (more details soon). To do this I was forced to study the DTD to figure out how to get all the data I needed. The documention did get me started as too some of the options but some of it was just plain wrong.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a tidbit others might find helpful. The documentation states that if you want to get the IIIRecord portion of a result (includes holdings and ISBN,etc.) then you need to enter the following in the URL string:\nnoexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRecord\nThis is actually incorrect as the XML server is case sensitive. The actual code you need is:\nnoexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD\nI figured this one out through studying the DTD. There\u0026rsquo;s some other things that caught me up. In order to use these options you need to make sure there is no trailing slash on the URL. For example:\npath.to.xml.opac/tgenetics/0/0/1/1/?noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD\nwill not return anything, but the following will:\npath.to.xml.opac/tgenetics/0/0/1/1?noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD\nNotice that there is no slash after the last \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;.

This is especially true for academic libraries that may have patrons from smaller towns where the library couldn\u0026rsquo;t offer such things. I still remember when my old library got it\u0026rsquo;s first computer. Online catalog? Forget it. I\u0026rsquo;m in my early twenties, so I\u0026rsquo;m sure patrons older than me might even have more extreme experiences.\nSo how do you help these users find out about these resources and help curb frustration? One way is contingency design. This is the process of planning for when things go wrong. A great resource for this is Defensive Design for the Webby the great usability folks over at 37 signals. I also recommend looking at their 37Better Projectsand Weblog. Take for example my library\u0026rsquo;s catalog. A keyword search that returns no results will automatically be reran as a word search. This may sound confusing (at least to me) because a keyword search is actually a phrase search. This is a topic for another discussion/rant.\nWhy not go a step further and put a small blurb at the top of the results page that\u0026rsquo;s dependent on the number of results, etc. Perhaps a \u0026quot;Having trouble finding what you want? Free live help is only a click away.\u0026quot; linking to your online reference help or contact information for your reference desk. Or perhaps a \u0026quot;Too many results? Try limiting your search.\u0026quot; with a link to the refine search page. I personally didn\u0026rsquo;t notice the refine search button on my search page as it blended into the navigation. I usually ended up just adding more words and trial and error. This is also an ideal place for things such as interlibrary loan and similar services. My catalog has a link to InMich, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure many people ignore, not knowing what it is. It might be more productive to put a more human text of \u0026quot;You can request books we don\u0026rsquo;t have through InMich\u0026quot; or something similar. Yes, this does take up a bit more room compared to a simple button, but if worked into the layout correctly, it may add more benefits than drawbacks. The \u0026quot;Did you mean\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; feature of Google adds some clutter, but for a typo prone person such as myself, it\u0026rsquo;s a lifesaver. There have been times that I would have never noticed my error if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been for that feature.\nAnother question I get a lot is if my library holds books for patrons. As far as I know (I learn more each day) we do not, but we do offer a recall service for checked out books. Many patrons do not know of this service. This might be helped with a simple link if the status of the book is checked out going to a page explaining the service. The words \u0026quot;Checked Out\u0026quot; could even be what links to it.\nAll of this information can be found somewhere on the library website, of course. But where the help is needed is where the problem is most likely to occur. By giving the patrons the help when they need it, it\u0026rsquo;s much more likely that they will be able to recover on their own or if not, find the help they need.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2004/11/helping-users-find-help/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s been a few comments that seemed to say that patrons need only ask a reference librarian if they don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do research.

The truth of the matter is that I\u0026rsquo;m a perpetual student whose major changes like the wind direction and who just happens to work at a library. I also have a lot of hobbies, many of which are technology related.\nIn a former blog life I wrote about technology in education. I have plans on restoring the archives of that blog and may post some of my old thoughts here if they are still pertinent. Though my major has changed continually since then, my interests haven\u0026rsquo;t. I like to work with technology and more specifically how people can (or do) use it.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll see in this blog are my ideas of possible technology solutions, responses to other peoples' ideas and the occasional rant. Feel free to leave your comments as I\u0026rsquo;m always interested in other peoples experiences and opinions. It\u0026rsquo;s probably important to know where I\u0026rsquo;m coming from though. During my stint as an education major, I worked with kids of various ages and a few teachers, all of which rarely had more than very basic technology skills. The children were often those with learning disabilities or what would be labeled by the school as a \u0026quot;problem child\u0026quot;. It may seem that I\u0026rsquo;m dumbing things down sometimes perhaps too much. Feel free to call me on it, but in some cases I will have to say there is no excuse for something to be so complicated. \u0026quot;Easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible.\u0026quot; is a saying that should be considered.\nFor those who think their users don\u0026rsquo;t fall in this category, I reserve my doubts. I currently work as tech support for my library. This includes non-tech related questions as well and I assure you there are plenty of patrons at least at my library that have problems with the library that may be overlooked by librarians or others. I hope to share those insights as much as I can.\nOn a side note, I will often mock-up examples of what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about in order to help illustrate my ideas, as I\u0026rsquo;m sure my explanations would be helped by them. These are all quick hack-jobs and may not work by the time you see them. I\u0026rsquo;m hosting this on one of my servers at home and my internet isn\u0026rsquo;t the greatest. My development skills are also lacking in many areas. Also many of these examples will say MSU Libraries.

The majority of the ones I read were positive and loved the idea, outside of some library related ones. There seemed to be some worry that it destroyed the possibility for federated search at a library. Here is a summary of my opinions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll begin with the statement that I like it. I wish something like this would have been around in the past when I was writing up some research papers. The killer feature in my mind is the ability to easily see who cites what. I can then easily find the abstracts (at least) and see which papers are relevant and that I should try to acquire. The ability to search the web for related items is also useful, as I may be able to find some background information that might make it easier for me to understand.\nThere are a few features I would like to see, however. My main beef is access to everything through an API. Being able to integrate this into a library site (without nasty hacks) would be a godsend. It\u0026rsquo;d also be helpful if the DOI\u0026rsquo;s were used more often, though with this being an early beta, I can see that improving over time. There\u0026rsquo;s a couple usability problems, such as when I choose to look at what works cite a resource, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell me what resource I was previously looking at. I have to hit the back button to see where I came from. It\u0026rsquo;d be nice if it told me whether it was an abstract or not as well, but I realize that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be easy. Marking things that have a Creative Commons license would be nice though.\nSo what about the problems people are talking about. From what I can gather some fear for the viability of federated search. As a user of a library (I am not a Librarian) I can say, I hope federated search happens soon and it is built well. I personally hate using the online indexes that my library provides. As a user I think they are a pain to use, look terrible, and don\u0026rsquo;t give the relevant results I want. I plan on using Google Scholar to find the article I need and then moving to the indexes and library catalog to find a copy of it. Before I would do web searches and try to find sites that sourced some information or the similar.\nI think this is where it becomes apparent of the difference between the students and the professional researcher. The professional researcher probably won\u0026rsquo;t use Google Scholar as much as a student. (Except maybe to see who cites them.) I think professional researchers are more likely to know the exact terms to search for, what journals/indexes are most relevant and even what other others are prominent. A student is more likely to be walking in blind and this is where the ease of use of Google comes in handy. There are many traps that a student could fall into using Google Scholar as their sole source of research information. There are plenty of students I think fall into the trap of using generic websites because they either don\u0026rsquo;t know of the resources available to them or they just can\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to use them.\nIf anything good comes from this I hope it gives libraries and academic institutions the motivation to educate their users how to judge the credibility of information and what resources are available to them. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked as a student at my library and I still have no idea about what all is available to me. Some of this is due to difficulty finding the exact information I need on the site and also due to me not having a reason to use certain resources. I went ahead and mocked up an example of how a library could use an informational site to show how to use Google Scholar WITH library resources. I used the library I use as an example, so all links, etc. will go to them. A side note, I found a few resources I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about while making it.\nUsing Google Scholar In Your Library","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2004/11/google-scholar-and-the-fury-unleashed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, \u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003eGoogle Scholar\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e was unveiled, followed by numerous blog posts about it.

The benefits can be numerous, but some limitations have to be kept in mind. I\u0026rsquo;ll first discuss the possibilities of such a venture, then the quirks.\nThe benefits for small libraries are probably minimal. The possibilities are the most promising for institutions that have a large audio archive and the ability to digitize the audio if need be. Any library can allow patrons to listen to music, but if the library has a audio archive it becomes a way of advertising the holdings of the institution.\nAn example of this would be the Vincent Voice Libraryat Michigan State University. This archives consists of thousands of audio items. If a server was provided for that department to feature certain recordings, it may bring users that would have never thought of using the service. An example would be speeches by Civil Rights activists during Black History Month, speeches by Einstein during the recent anniversary of his work, and other special events. Music is also a definite option, especially during appreciation months, etc. An additional benefit is the seamless experience for patrons. All they have to do is plug into the network and load iTunes. They may even discover the resource on accident.\nThere are various things that have to be kept in mine if something like this was implemented. Firstly iTunes itself only allows 5 computers to connect to it with sharing (last time I checked). This is due to the limitations on sharing iTunes store material, but applies to sharing in general. A possible way around this might be to use a compliant server such as daapd. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the server has similar limitations as iTunes.\nThis limitation brings up the possible problem of copyright. While the music is streamed to the client and not downloaded and is limited to the subnet of the server, I could see this as being construed as a public performance. Being a library and being used as an educational reason, it might fall under fair use, but this is definitely something that would have to be looked into before implementing a system. Public domain material is always an option and this could be the perfect way to expose patrons to older, more obscure material they might not hear otherwise.\nA few other problems exist. The protocol used to broadcast is limited to the same subnet as it will not make it past routers without some additional tinkering. More information on that can be found on the daapdsite. Another problem is the use of iTunes on public PC\u0026rsquo;s. In small libraries this may not pose a problem, but in larger institutions it may become a problem as users try to load their own mp3\u0026rsquo;s or similar onto the system, or not realize why it\u0026rsquo;s there. An alternative to that is AppleRecords, a open-source client that connects to the daapd server and allows the streaming of the material (and that\u0026rsquo;s about it). Patrons with their own laptops with iTunes can just access it with what they have. Bandwidth is also an issue depending on usage.\nAs a quick wrap-up, the possibilities are interesting, but if such a project was undertaken, it would be important to plan it out as it is not as simple as loading songs onto iTunes and hitting share, unfortunately.\n","permalink":"https://ryaneby.com/2004/11/using-itunes-in-the-library/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently came across \u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003ea post on Tame the Web\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e that discussed the possibility of using iTunes at a library to serve audio files to patrons.
