      <description>Cross-posted from the AADL Devblog
The AADL Summer Game has an online shop where earned points can be spent on awesome schwag. To try to make it easy for the volunteers and staff to fulfill the orders we took advantage of some of the infrastructure we already had in place for other parts of the site.
As some know our hold notices currently go through a script that sends an email along with printing a custom label to a label printer, that is used for identification on our hold shelves.</description>

<p>The <a href="http://play.aadl.org">AADL Summer Game</a> has an online shop where earned points can be spent on awesome schwag. To try to make it easy for the volunteers and staff to fulfill the orders we took advantage of some of the infrastructure we already had in place for other parts of the site.</p>
<p>As some know our hold notices currently go through a script that sends an email along with printing a custom label to a label printer, that is used for identification on our hold shelves. We reused this process to print a custom pickup/order label everytime an order comes through the <a href="http://www.ubercart.org/">ubercart</a> game shop by hooking into the payment process. This leaves a spool of order labels that those doing fulfillment can pick up throughout the week and start filling. A spool that has been increasing dramatically in length recently.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As orders are filled the barcode on the custom label is scanned, which sets the order as fulfilled and adds a notification job to a <a href="http://redis.io">redis</a> queue. Players have the option of getting SMS notifications (sent through <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a>) or email. Shop keepers can also cancel orders if need be which refunds the points to the player account.</p>
<p>After the items are delivered to the branch destinations on Friday morning, a script goes through the jobs on the redis queue and sends the notifications letting players know their items are ready for pickup.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>More background info on our <a href="http://play.aadl.org">Summer Game</a> is in the works and keep that order spool growing!</p>

The 2011 Summer Game has brought big changes to the way we play here at the library. In addition to the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; summer reading game, players can earn points for writing reviews, adding comments and finding game codes at events and locations. Players also earn badges for special accomplishments. We just passed player ID #4000 and we still have weeks to go for even more players to join and earn points and prizes.</description>

<p>The 2011 Summer Game has brought big changes to the way we play here at the library. In addition to the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; summer reading game, players can earn points for writing reviews, adding comments and finding game codes at events and locations. Players also earn badges for special accomplishments. We just passed player ID #4000 and we still have weeks to go for even more players to join and earn points and prizes. The pieces that make up the Summer Game are diverse but by adding custom code to the solid foundations provided by these open tools we&rsquo;ve been able to concentrate our efforts on adding new content and functionality rather than chasing bugs and putting out fires. Here&rsquo;s some of the tools and technologies that make up the Summer Game:</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>: The aadl.org websites run on the Drupal Content Management System. In addition to giving us a framework for writing blogs, creating user accounts and writing comments, it has a extensive API which allows us to leverage those pieces to add our own functionality. A drupal module for Summer Game was created that keeps track of player data, lets players add points through multiple activities, and displays a leaderboard. Players are attached to user accounts, and a simple function which could be placed in any code that runs the site allows us to award points for any website action. The summer game module is available through github: <a href="https://github.com/aadl/Summer-Game">Summer Game module</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubercart.org/">Ubercart</a>: The Summer Game shop runs on this Drupal module that provides a simple shop interface for your Drupal site. Again, it has a extensive API which allowed us to use Summer Game points as a custom payment type. We also added a hook into the order process to send data to our custom label printing function, printing labels for the items at the time of order, and creating custom order emails. By leveraging the ubercart module, we were able to create a complete online shop and order fulfillment process in about 3 weeks, start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fpdf.org/">FPDF</a>/<a href="http://www.setasign.de/products/pdf-php-solutions/fpdi/">FPDI</a>: The core of the Summer Game is still the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; summer reading game, where you read books, fill out a score card, bring it to a library location and get a prize. This year we decided to track all our score cards with unique identifier numbers to see where and when people picked them up. We also wanted to allow players to print their score cards on demand as PDF files. The FPDF library allows us to dynamically create each score card PDF with a unique number. We also use the FPDF library to create easily-printable Game Code signs so staff can post a points-accruing Game Code at their events. The FPDI plugin for FPDF allows you to import an existing PDF as a template for your FPDF document.</p>
<p><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>: Redis provides a persistent data store, similar to a database, but as key-value pairs rather than tables. We used Redis to store the score card identification numbers because it allowed us to do an atomic increment operation. We don&rsquo;t want two people printing score cards at the same time with the same ID number. In a single call we can get the next number in the sequence without worrying about holding other people up or both grabbing the same number. We also use Redis to store our shop email notification data in a processing queue which allows us to delay sending them out. We currently use the <a href="https://github.com/jdp/redisent">Redisent PHP library</a> to talk to our Redis install.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>: Twilio provides an easy API to interact with users via cell phone text messages. By creating a simple drupal module that utilizes the Twilio API we allowed players at an event to easily sign up for the game and start earning points using their cell phones. We also use twilio to send prize pickup reminder text messages when we fill orders from the Summer Game shop.</p>

      <title>Forcing Download with nginx</title>
      <link>https://ryaneby.com/2011/04/forcing-download-with-nginx/</link>

      <description>Prompting a browser to download rather than open something is rather common. You can do so from your favorite web programming language by adding the Content-Disposition attachment header when sending the data back.
This can come in handy if you want to use the same file for both web serving and download. Say a MP4 movie file. It makes it a little easier than the right-click save-as method.
If you want to remove the overhead of serving a file through a script you can also accomplish this straight in nginx.</description>

<p>This can come in handy if you want to use the same file for both web serving and download. Say a MP4 movie file. It makes it a little easier than the right-click save-as method.</p>
<p>If you want to remove the overhead of serving a file through a script you can also accomplish this straight in <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/">nginx</a>. In the example below the file can be served both ways.</p>
<p>Served normally: <a href="http://example.org/mymovie.mp4">http://example.org/mymovie.mp4</a></p>
<p>Served as attachment: <a href="http://example.org/mymovie.mp4?name=mymovie.mp4">http://example.org/mymovie.mp4?name=mymovie.mp4</a></p>
<p>This would go inside the location declaration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx">  <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">(</span>$args<span style="color:#e6db74">)</span>{
    <span style="color:#f92672">add_header</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">X-Content-Type-Options</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">nosniff</span>;
    <span style="color:#f92672">add_header</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">Content-Type</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;application/octet-stream&#34;</span>;
    <span style="color:#f92672">add_header</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">Content-Disposition</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;attachment</span>; <span style="color:#f92672">filename=&#34;$arg_name&#34;&#39;</span>;
  }</code></pre></div>
<p>This also gives you the option of having the downloaded file be named differently. So if you have directory structure like /2011/mysong.mp3 you could have it save as 2011-mysong.mp3.</p>
<p>This also lets you take advantage of other nginx features like <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/X-accel">X-accel</a> when serving or streaming the files.</p>

      <title>Staff Requests in SOPAC</title>

      <description>Cross-posted from the AADL Devblog
Over the past few years we&amp;rsquo;ve taken advantage of having a catalog we can tweak and change. Recently as we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to store more data outside of the ILS we have gone the route of making our catalog one of main development platforms.
However, staff still had to go back to the staff client for the ILS for some functions. While many of those functions don&amp;rsquo;t really make sense as part of the catalog, requesting items for other patrons was one that did.</description>

<p>However, staff still had to go back to the staff client for the ILS for some functions. While many of those functions don&rsquo;t really make sense as part of the catalog, requesting items for other patrons was one that did. Having full control over the search and what fields are indexed created a back and forth between the client and website for finding things.</p>
<p>We just rolled out the feature for staff so they can request for others via the public catalog (if they have the permission). Its a feature I&rsquo;d recommend looking at implementing if you are working on an opac replacement or other catalog like feature.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Just one more step moving more non-inventory things to the drupal/sopac side of things rather than the ILS.</p>

      <title>Availability in Globally Distributed Storage Systems</title>

      <description>Google just released a research paper entitled Availability in Globally Distributed Storage Systems. It is available for download in PDF format (14 pages). From the abstract:
 We characterize the availability properties of cloud storage systems based on an extensive one year study of Google&amp;rsquo;s main storage infrastructure and present statistical models that enable further insight into the impact of multiple design choices, such as data placement and replication strategies. With these models we compare data availability under a variety of system parameters given the real patterns of failures observed in our fleet.</description>

<p>It is worth taking a quick browse of. The paper focuses on data availability (online versus data backup/integrity) and includes things like planned downtime. Metrics are given to assist in system design. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>GFS waits around 15 minutes before trying recovery process as that is more than the average time a node might return itself to normal operation (reboot, etc)</li>
<li>Many events are rack and multi-rack level (network, rolling reboots, etc)</li>
<li>Failures tend to happen in bursts</li>
<li>Important to take the above two into account when planning replication schemes</li>
<li>Reboot time is important</li>
<li>Storing data across data centers reduces data unavailability by many orders of magnitude compared to having the same number of replicas in a single data center</li>
</ul>

      <title>Bagit Validation and CIJoe</title>
      <link>https://ryaneby.com/2011/02/bagit-validation-and-cijoe/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started playing around with bagit and some of the other curation microservices. One of the features involved is manifest files w/ checksums of all the data files in the bag. So far I&amp;rsquo;m still just getting the hang of it but decided to try cbeer&amp;rsquo;s bagit gem and try hooking the validate function to cijoe integration server. With the bag in git repository it was easy to have cijoe run a simple script that returned zero when validated, or one with output if there was a problem.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve started playing around with <a href="https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt">bagit</a> and some of the other <a href="https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/Home">curation microservices</a>. One of the features involved is manifest files w/ checksums of all the data files in the bag. So far I&rsquo;m still just getting the hang of it but decided to try <a href="https://github.com/cbeer/bagit">cbeer&rsquo;s bagit gem</a> and try hooking the validate function to <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe">cijoe</a> integration server. With the bag in git repository it was easy to have cijoe run a simple script that returned zero when validated, or one with output if there was a problem. cijoe can use git hooks to notify via various methods (example one for email is given in repo).</p>
<p>While not robust it only took a minute to get the output displayed:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5455986619_3296f6881b.jpg" alt="bagit and cijoe"  />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebyryan/5455986619/sizes/l/">larger version</a></p>
<p>A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>need to tweak cijoe to work on local repository instead of requiring an origin</li>
<li>keeping the validation script in the repository helps. should probably validate/manifest it as well</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall a lot easier than I thought it would be and serves as a simple interface for seeing current status for those who like a webpage. cijoe also has jsonp and a simple http status api that allows other tools to easily look at build status so seems like it could be an easy tool to run all your tests in one place and let various things ping it.</p>

      <title>IE8 Upgrade and Enhanced Security Stuck For Some Profiles</title>

      <description>Had an issue with IE upgrades in the recent past where after the upgrade multiple pre-existing profiles would state they were in &amp;ldquo;Enhanced Security Mode&amp;rdquo; despite that mode being disabled. New profiles would work fine and Administrator usually did as well.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to track down, MS hasn&amp;rsquo;t figured out the exact circumstances that cause it. Fresh installs w/ upgrades before anyone logs in seem to work fine in my experience.</description>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve been able to track down, MS hasn&rsquo;t figured out the exact circumstances that cause it. Fresh installs w/ upgrades before anyone logs in seem to work fine in my experience. Some profiles would also work fine despite being similar to ones that did.</p>
<p>Searches brought up multiple hacks to fix it. One is to make a login script that modifies the registry like so for every user:</p>
<pre><code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
&quot;IEHardenIENoWarn&quot;=dword:00000000

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap]
&quot;IEHarden&quot;=dword:00000000
</code></pre>
<p>The best solution I found, though, was to use GPO and force a setting for the Internet Zone. Forcing it to Medium or whatever level appears to get pass the enhanced security issues and things work like normal.</p>
<p>Under either User or Computer depending on how you have GPO setup you would want to enable and set a level for:</p>
<pre><code>Administrative Templates&gt;Windows Components&gt;Internet Explorer&gt;Internet Control Panel&gt;Security Page&gt;Internet Zone
</code></pre>
<p>Not ideal but it is the best I&rsquo;ve found</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert with unicode and ran into various problems in getting Sphinx up and running with bib data for SOPAC2. Below is an overview of what I ended up doing to solve it. There are probably better ways of doing it and if so please share.
The Sphinx I&amp;rsquo;m referring to is the indexing/search programthat works well with MySQL. The case below is using the stock searchd/indexer interface and not the mysql engine which is probably different.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can convert tables and all the fields within the table with the command (from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pythoneer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-mysql" data-lang="mysql"><span style="color:#66d9ef">ALTER</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">TABLE</span> tbl_name <span style="color:#66d9ef">CONVERT</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">TO</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">CHARACTER</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">SET</span> utf8 <span style="color:#66d9ef">COLLATE</span> utf8_unicode_ci;</code></pre></div>
<p>You could also do utf8_general_ci. From what I&rsquo;ve picked up online is that the unicode_ci supports expansions/ligatures while the general doesn&rsquo;t which can affect sorting. However, the docs say the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the tradeoff is speed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in some operations. Both lack some character support versus the actual Unicode Collation Algorithm.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You will want to set your index definition to have:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-mysql" data-lang="mysql">charset_type <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> utf<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span></code></pre></div>
<p>While the docs mostly just mention that I highly recommend adding the following to your source definition:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-mysql" data-lang="mysql">sql_query_pre <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">SET</span> CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>utf8
sql_query_pre <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">SET</span> NAMES utf8</code></pre></div>
<p>While you might think that having your tables in utf8 collation, mysql set to default to it and php encoding in utf8 would be enough, if the client doesn&rsquo;t specify that it is doing utf8 mysql will store it in whatever encoding it thinks it is getting. I battled with php configs to try to ensure all machines modifying the tables were talking the same but you&rsquo;ll save yourself the trouble by defining this here and also in your scripts that write to the tables.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As stated above I&rsquo;d recommend doing a SET NAMES utf8 in front of your queries inserting data into mysql. This again may be poor setup on my part but it helps rule out different client configurations and probably makes it more portable. I found Gentoo by default seems to do fine, Debian hit or miss. Adding the SET made it work where ever I tried.</p>
<p>Some documentation stated I should wipe database if it previously had other encodings. I found this unnecessary and just inserted the data with UPDATE or REPLACE INTO and had no issues.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While stop words and similar allow you to use external files for the list, it appears character folding needs the list to be in the config itself. At least I haven&rsquo;t been able to get an include file to work. I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing otherwise. Depending on the languages you have you may want to generate a list of the codes present in your dataset. Otherwise you can find some tables to try out here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some reported that Sphinx can have issues with long lines in the config so you may need to break up the lines with \ characters. Your list should also include &ldquo;0..9, a..z, A..Z-&gt;a..z&rdquo; in it as you are overriding the default list.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another thing to note with Sphinx is that many changes to the sphinx.conf requires a restart of searchd. With the modification of the folding table you&rsquo;ll probably want to do this. Restart searchd and then do your indexer run for your indexes.</p>
<p>Try out some searches with keywords/characters and watch the query log. If the character folding is working then you should see the encoded characters in the query log. If they are missing or replaced by spaces then the characters aren&rsquo;t matching up with your folding table. Try to find the character, add it to your list, restart searchd and reindex. Sphinx defaults to not accepting characters that are not in the charset_table list. The query log is the easiest point to diagnose this at.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The last step is of course to make sure your web pages are served in a proper encoding so browsers render it properly.</p>
<p>Again this isn&rsquo;t in depth but hopefully will help those messing with Sphinx.</p>

Most of the findings line up with experience but nice to see them quantified. Many preferred html versions for printability, layout, etc. Also covers workflow, costs.

      <description>(also posted on the AADL devblog)
We recently overhauled the public computing setup at AADL, though it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been rolled out at all the branches yet. It consists of a mix of linux hosted web management software, linux thin clients and windows terminal servers. It is a bit of a unique setup so figure I should share. Once we get it farther towards complete we&amp;rsquo;ll probably release the code.
For some background the previous setup consisted of windows thinclients and windows servers running Citrix.</description>

<p>We recently overhauled the public computing setup at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AADL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though it hasn&rsquo;t been rolled out at all the branches yet. It consists of a mix of linux hosted web management software, linux thin clients and windows terminal servers. It is a bit of a unique setup so figure I should share. Once we get it farther towards complete we&rsquo;ll probably release the code.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For some background the previous setup consisted of windows thinclients and windows servers running Citrix. The thin clients had published application sets that connected to a fairly basic server farm. The farm wasn&rsquo;t really setup well resulting in high loads and slow logins. A custom set of flash applications and php gateways administered it all.</p>
<p>As I researched options I decided I wanted to drop Citrix as I didn&rsquo;t really see it as needed and the licensing costs aren&rsquo;t exactly small. I also decided I would prefer as much be opensource as possible though we decided on keeping Windows for the public facing part for now.</p>
<p>I tested out quite a few public computing management software, lockdown software, cyber cafe software but didn&rsquo;t really find anything that did everything I wanted, kept it fairly simple, was flexible, etc. For reference here are a few things about our setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patrons can use the computer as long as they want without interruption unless there are other patrons waiting for a computer. They have a minimum 30 minutes if there is a line, after which they are given 5, 2, 1 minute warnings.</li>
<li>They can be idle for a total of 10 minutes before being ended (given a warning after 5)</li>
<li>They swipe their card at an assigner first that gives them a station. These are spaced out then random</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The thin clients we settled on are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HP Compaq t5735 Thin Clients<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In bulk they ran under $250 each. The specs worked out for what we needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>VESA mountable on both sides. Made it easy to securely mount to tables and even to the back of monitors</li>
<li>1 GB Flash, 256M RAM</li>
<li>VGA and DVI</li>
<li>Lots of USB ports including back, front and secure (within case)</li>
<li>Debian Linux preinstalled (stock plus some custom HP packages)</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing I like most about the thin clients is the imaging process. The clients come with a HP programs called HPThinState which can write a bootable imager to a USB drive. Once the USB is imaged you can boot other machines from the USB and walk through a simple imaging process. The process is simple enough that front line staff now image machines themselves when needed (usually ext3 partition corruption after power failure). This has significantly cut time of IT staff and reduced how long a client is out of order for simple problems.</p>
<p>Another nice thing is that all changes are put on flash immediately, no special write/flashing software needed. You can apt-get upgrade and have the changes there on reboot with no further interaction.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the biggest problems we had previously was USB ports being damaged on clients. We tried multiple things like hubs, etc but nothing really lasted. Our latest attempt is using a modular box that is meant to be inserted in a 5.25 cd bay on a tower. We put 2 usb extenders and a headphone jack extender in it and mount it to the table. This leaves an easily replaceable port and also lets us move the thin client out of harms way. So far this has worked great and we haven&rsquo;t had to replace a port yet. At about $10-12 it can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We have USB floppy drives available for use and may expand to other formats. The monitors are stock though we add on privacy screens. Each station is also equipped with a USB based barcode reader that is used for signin purposes.</p>
<p>We also have one of the thin clients VESA mounted to a monitor and barcode reader that acts as the assigner.</p>
<p>More information on the actual software / workflow behind it coming up in a second post. Overall though we&rsquo;ve been really happy with the hardware described above. Really stable and much better priced.</p>

      <description>Just a reminder that the library camp is tomorrow, Thursday March 20th. More information is on libsuccess.org:
The goal is to get a bunch of people together, and let them talk about whatever they&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about, within the rough purview of libraries and library technology. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with all getting together with a blank schedule to talk about what we&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about and fill in a few slots on the agenda.</description>

We&rsquo;ll start with all getting together with a blank schedule to talk about what we&rsquo;d like to talk about and fill in a few slots on the agenda. We&rsquo;ve got time for four sessions and room for at least 3 concurrent sessions, so there could easily be 10-12 different things to talk about during the day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on providing breakfast; lunch is on your own, but there will surely be groups heading out to nearby places in downtown Ann Arbor. There is also a mid-range hotel near by (The Campus Inn, $200/night, orbitz has for $99/night), and a very cheap place a little further out that&rsquo;s not half bad (Lamp Post Inn, $45/night). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably read elsewhere Google finally released a way to get book availability on Google Books. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly simple web service where you hand it an identifier and it gives back whether the book is on Google Books and how much so (no view, partial view, full view) along with cover images. AADL previously scraped for the information which I&amp;rsquo;ve now disabled and used the new API instead. It was fairly easy with a little jquery and small changes to catwrap.</description>

<p>And as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim at LibraryThing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jrochkind found<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they seem to be going for basic and client side which limits what you can do with it. I haven&rsquo;t had time to look into what&rsquo;s allowed in terms of caching or how many requests per client before being shut down. It would probably help to do the calls server side and cache for all the lccn/oclc/isbn possibilities in the long run.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still digesting all the discussions and information from code4lib but I remembered a conversation I eavesdropped on. Casey reminded me it was between him and Adam Brin of Tri-College. The gist was that they had put a &amp;ldquo;txt this record to me&amp;rdquo; feature onto the catalog, without any real demand, which then took off to everyone&amp;rsquo;s surprise. It was one of those &amp;ldquo;that would be cool&amp;rdquo; that then turned into a &amp;ldquo;how did we do without it&amp;rdquo; for some students.</description>

You can see an example on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Selfish Gene<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The feature itself sends the title and location info to your cellphone via SMS. They are using the free SMS email gateways I believe while Casey <!-- raw HTML omitted -->went with a pay service<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Most of my SMS plans allowed free incoming so I would have probably used this during my long college years. With the potential younger audience at public libraries I&rsquo;ve heard discussion on whether kids racking up SMS charges using the catalog would be a good thing. Ed would also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like free alternatives<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which probably wouldn&rsquo;t be hard for email if your already using the email gateways. I&rsquo;ve already thought about all his options including adding it to our twitter script. When I revisit catwrap I&rsquo;m going to look more into custom catalog experiences based on profile information such as twitter, email, phone, etc. With a little information in the profile it would be possible to slim down the display with just the applicable features (send to twitter, send to del.icio.us, etc).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been on and off <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> quite a few times. It never really caught on with me. I commute between two different cities and most of my contacts are elsewhere in the world. The majority of the ones I meet up with aren&rsquo;t on the site nor are technology inclined. I do see the usefulness of the service for time and location aware information, though. A few things I wish for:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s actually already a commuter aggregator called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CommuterFeed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which looks interesting and I remember reading at least one story about a DOT using twitter. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flying Dog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is on twitter but i see quite a few business possibilities. Slow hour at the pub? Twitter a special on beers for the next 20 minutes (presuming you have foot traffic).</p>
<p>Quite a few libraries also got on twitter. David Lee King has at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a partial list<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Most have gone the route of using rss2twitter or similar to send out additions to their sites, etc. I didn&rsquo;t really see the major benefit of that so I&rsquo;ve stayed away from it. I do see the benefit of doing some announcements on it, especially since the audience may be the kind that want&rsquo;s to try out beta quality apps or are technology friendly.</p>
<p>The big use I see are for events. Since we&rsquo;ve recently rehauled our event backend I thought I&rsquo;d try hooking it into Twitter. Since there is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PHP class<!-- raw HTML omitted --> available for the api, it became really quick and easy to try things out. Now 30 minutes before each event a tweet is sent out as a reminder. I&rsquo;ve also sent out a few manual tweets asking for feedback on some quick iCal feeds and alerts of some videos added to the site (also built on the new events system). You can follow at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twitter.com/aadl<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you think you would get benefit from it. The route will likely be towards a SMS/IM bot type of application.</p>
<p>Here are some of the other ideas I&rsquo;ve had, some more feasible than others. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has also been helpful with trying things out and giving some feedback.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a few possibilities for mobile/time/location dependent services a library provides that show potential. You&rsquo;ll probably see quite a few posts about the event system in the future. It has become the backbone of quite a few services including our recently launched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->streaming video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Once iCal is done I&rsquo;ll probably move on to hcal Atom service or similar for building external apps on.</p>

Another Yahoo product I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into is Zimbra, a partially open-source collaboration suite which has taken off in recent years. It offers a replacement to Microsoft Exchange with the ability of Outlook and iSync to seamlessly use the calendaring, etc (with installed commercial addon).</description>

It offers a replacement to Microsoft Exchange with the ability of Outlook and iSync to seamlessly use the calendaring, etc (with installed commercial addon). With quite a few businesses and universities using Zimbra, it looked like a promising product.</p>
<p>Obviously the buyout by Microsoft could mean the death of the commercial version. The interesting discussion was regarding whether the open source part of the product could be forked under the licenses the part is under. The debate regarding GPL versus everything else turned into almost mouth foaming. Still, it was interesting to see the concerns various people had when it seems like many fear open source projects that don&rsquo;t have a commercial version/option. Many are calling for the commercial code to be put into a escrow that will be released under GPL if the commercial support for the product is pulled or the company bought out. Others hope yahoo spins it off or sells it prior to a takeover. Most didn&rsquo;t seem to like the alternative of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scalix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can see some of the debates here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most of the library open-source ILS projects don&rsquo;t seem to be in this area. They tend to sell support or custom implementations. The problem seems to occur when the companies start selling the more important features or features that set them apart as commercial. Email? Sure. Exchange replacement? Extra. I don&rsquo;t see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibLime<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Equinox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> going the route of building pieces  that libraries request as only commercial. From what I&rsquo;ve heard LibLime requires all custom work for libraries to be GPL&rsquo;d. I could potentially see other vendors like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Innovative<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SirsiDynix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OCLC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> releasing part of a product under GPL while keeping the parts libraries actually want closed source. Whether that&rsquo;s a model you want probably depends on what your looking for, but the yahoo debate should show that you may need to look closely on what they really mean by &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>

      <description>Photo by cwageIt&amp;rsquo;s probably a little too early here to even start some of the transplants but for those who like to garden, you might be interested in the Victory Garden Drive.
The gist is to get some friends and/or neighbors that haven&amp;rsquo;t to start at least a small garden this year. As for the term victory garden, from wikipedia:
It was emphasised to home front urbanites and suburbanites that the produce from their gardens would help to lower the price of vegetables needed by the War Department to feed the troops, thus saving money that could be spent elsewhere on the military: &amp;ldquo;Our food is fighting&amp;rdquo;, one poster read.</description>

      <description>A nice discussion about the Kindle and loaning in librariesover at Tinfoil+Raccoon. There&amp;rsquo;s some debate and confusion on what the TOC means:
and
One of the other problems that came up is the Amazon 1-click buying on the kindle (without password verification). Some decided to unregister the device from the account preventing purchases from being made though it was unclear if you can reregister later on.

      <description>We eat quite a bit of pork and since we&amp;rsquo;re both from farming backgrounds, figured we&amp;rsquo;d take a stab at growing some. Living in the city doesn&amp;rsquo;t really allow it (we&amp;rsquo;re trying to move where we could), but luckily some farmer friends grew some for us. They tend to grow rather quickly over the year, starting off rather small in the spring.
And they end up pretty damn big at the end:</description>

<p>Skinning is probably the most involved of the process, with lots of slicing. It took about an hour with three people.</p>

<p>We ended up taking half a pig home, giving the other half to the girlfriend&rsquo;s brother and sister in law. Overall a good yield, with plenty of bacon, loin and roasting meat. We&rsquo;re not fans of ham.</p>

      <title>Apache External Filters and PHP Sessions or Cookies</title>

      <description>Not needed in most cases but an interesting tool for some special ones. You can take advantage of browsers sending cookies with HTTP requests under a domain by using External Filters in Apache to modify the content based on those cookies. For example below we filter the requests for a specific location through a PHP script that can read the $_SERVER[&amp;lsquo;HTTP_COOKIE&amp;rsquo;], get the PHPSESSID, read the Drupal database or similar and modify the content depending on whether someone is logged in, anonymous, etc.</description>

<p>The php script would contain the logic of pulling the data out of the cookie, connecting to the DB, modifying content, etc. There&rsquo;s better ways to do this most of the time but in certain circumstances it could be used for content filtering or faked single sign-on with proxying. Apache will pass the proxied page to the script in that case.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen various discussions that have confused or equated privacy (or freedom) with anonymity. Things such as social DRM which marks items with some unique information. There a nice article by Schneier on the differences and relation to securitythat is worth reading.
That&amp;rsquo;s obvious and uninteresting, but many of us seem to forget it when we&amp;rsquo;re on a computer. We think &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s secure,&amp;rdquo; and forget that secure can mean many different things.</description>

      <description>As most who probably read this blog know, it was recently talk like a pirate day. Like the pirate bayusually does, Flickr changed their logo a bit. Via WaxyI found that there were at least a few that were not amused, from those who thought the interestingness was lackingto those who thought their accounts compromised or piracy officially supported.
The pirate bay usually includes an explanation, alt text or links to a search that gives a clue.</description>

      <description>(My Violent Wife by Jesse Gardnerfrom Flickr)
I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed reading K.G. Schneider&amp;rsquo;swriting (and presentations) and her essay for Nerveis no different. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already given it a read you should. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an occasional reader of Nerve and they tend to have great writing so it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see her featured there.
While there I would also suggest Trouble in Pornoland. On a side note I found that on Flickr there are multiple interpretations of girls with guns.</description>

      <description>The Librarian in Black has a post about a service that provides time-released RSSwhich they call AutoResponder. The price seems a bit steep but it is centered towards business.
The idea has been around for awhile and the first major use I saw was the delivery of book chapters over time. One example is Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s Someone comes to Town, Someone leaves Town.
Feed Hosteris the hosting provider for the feed, who offers serialized options.</description>

      <description>One of benefits of gaming that fits well with libraries, is the social aspect. The library provides a neutral place for gaming that allows for competition while remaining sane. While most seem to be focused on console games it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see places like UAH Libraryalso do a LAN Party.
As for the social aspect, there is a keynote from PAX 2007 by Wil Wheatonthat appears to be worth a listen.</description>

      <description>The first being Operator, a firefox extension that helps with the use of microformats, including things such as exporting hcard contacts. It now boasts support for RDFa and eRDF and has changed its description to be more about the use of semantic data, rather then just microformats.
The second is Zotero, another Firefox extension which is focused on collecting information for research and the like. New features includes the ability to index the PDF&amp;rsquo;s collected and better Word integration.</description>

      <description>A couple quick book reviews:
Drugs are nice: a post-punk memoirby Lisa Carver
Enjoyed it quite a bit. Can be deperessing at times but gives a window into a world most see from outside. She&amp;rsquo;s not yet old but she&amp;rsquo;s already experienced enough to fill this volume and probably more. It&amp;rsquo;s the story of a teen publisher, wife and prostitute. The title refers to an album by her group Suckdog which is available from at least one library.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is about the anticipation of the moment and the memory of the moment, but not the moment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The book is a collection of essays <!-- raw HTML omitted -->published on edge.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The essays are grouped by their topic so it can seem repetitive at times but also shows the various reasons people have for believing their specific idea. The ideas range from one to many universes, consciousness, afterlife and science itself. Most of the essays are short so it reads rather fast. Worth picking up.</p>

      <description>One of my favorite science magazines is Seedwhich also hosts a great collection of science blogs. Today, via boing boing, I found out that they are being sueddue to a negative book review. Hopefully it turns out well but it is something to keep an eye on.
That said a negative review has been in me for years and its probably time to let it out before the courts get hold.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits of knowing lots of farmers is the ability to buy local or from small farms where you have at least of an idea where things are coming from. Quite a few of our meals this summer have been completely from either our garden or from relatives&#39; farms. Besides plenty of pheasant, quail, heritage chickens and other poultry, we are having a pig raised for us. For the curious here is a picture of when we first saw them:</description>

<p>It will be a few more months before we go up and butcher them and hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to do a more complete blog post of our experiences. Related to that, with the large number of houses on the market and my job change, we&rsquo;re looking at moving out of the city to some place where we can raise more animals and produce.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a nice post over at LibraryTechtonics about geocachingand the problem with associating literacy with just books:
There&amp;rsquo;s a similar misconception with gaming, that it only provides entertainment and no educational value. The post hits a second point which I think is also very important, which is actually getting people to use the library that otherwise would have likely lived and died without ever visiting it.
Worth a read.</description>

<p>Back to the post, the discussion is centered around the problem with having URI alias' for a single item like Wikipedia does. What is authoritative URI that should be used for identification. DBpedia does not have aliases which makes it clear though translating URI&rsquo;s from Wikipedia to DBpedia can be a more involved process because of it.</p>
<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s interesting to see the things that are going on in the semantic web area and how all the data can be linked together and it&rsquo;s potential for discovery and catalog displays.</p>

      <description>A nice post on geodata and the mass annotation of geo-spacial data. We&amp;rsquo;re not making maps, we&amp;rsquo;re annotating space. It then goes on to data formats and the need for more open data:
I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this since they first showed a demo. Has a lot of potential of open access publishing I think.
Your site needs to be useful even if only one person uses it.</description>

      <description>A recent post by Anil Dashis worth reading and goes over the use of &amp;ldquo;toread&amp;rdquo; as a tag:
via Christina&amp;rsquo;s LIS RantI found that there is now a paper about the use of tags as emotional or task related(pdf) instead of actually about the work. These are tags such as toread, toblog, fun, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;m guilty of using toread and toblog more then I should as it is unlikely I&amp;rsquo;ll actually get back to the items.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m guilty of using toread and toblog more then I should as it is unlikely I&rsquo;ll actually get back to the items. Maybe I should just use bitrot or blackhole instead. Some of the tags are useful and interesting to wade through, though. Looking at LibraryThing&rsquo;s list for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->must read<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->favorite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recommended<!-- raw HTML omitted --> probably tells you more about the items then just ratings alone. There&rsquo;s obviously less data but even AADL&rsquo;s SOPAC has tags like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BestOfMine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to read<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>While not directly related to the content of the item in the way traditional classification would be, it adds a level of information about the work you might not get otherwise. Finding a book about economics that&rsquo;s fun to read is a little easier with more emotional tags.</p>

They&amp;rsquo;ve added a new feature which is probably one of the most useful things I&amp;rsquo;ve used recently.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking about a Zen OPAC idea for quite awhile and now see that dchud thinks similarly. My first thought was to use some of the requirements being that it uses markup similar to what current template set-ups allow in commercial OPACs. I then scraped that and thought should be from scratch and try to get the most semantic markup as possible.

My first thought was to use some of the requirements being that it uses markup similar to what current template set-ups allow in commercial OPACs. I then scraped that and thought should be from scratch and try to get the most semantic markup as possible. Regardless, I think the markup will be the first step and probably the most time intensive. Once the markup is decided it will be cool to see what people do with it. Hopefully the idea takes off with dchud behind it and not just my musings.</p>
<p>In relation to this, when I first looked at markup I looked at things like the early discussion for hcite and other microformats. Then I remembered <!-- raw HTML omitted -->COinS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and figured that might work. My memory apparently failed as I thought it was more useful then a single span with a nasty openurl string in it. As it is I&rsquo;m not surprised not many use it. I was hoping for a more microformat-ish setup with a span for COinS and then sub-classes for the various key-value pairs. As it stands it doesn&rsquo;t seem very useful for things other then the few openurl use cases. Hopefully things proceed with hcite or a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mashup of other formats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that might add at least a bit more usefulness then a semi-hidden partial link.</p>
<p>Regardless I look forward to seeing what comes of the zen opac idea.</p>

      <description>The idea of mobile reference was first brought to my attention by Alan Gray at Darien who has a nice post on the topic on his blog. He terms the current desk situation as siege warfare.
Note to Alan: I know your extremely busy but please keep sharing the ideas on the blog. Or have Blyberg transcribe them to his.
The topic also seems to be gaining traction in academic libraries with a debate on the topic taking placewith the end idea that desks should go away by 2012.</description>

<p>Note to Alan: I know your extremely busy but please keep sharing the ideas on the blog. Or have Blyberg transcribe them to his.</p>
<p>The topic also seems to be gaining traction in academic libraries with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->debate on the topic taking place<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the end idea that desks should go away by 2012. There&rsquo;s some arguments for and against the idea and it didn&rsquo;t go over smoothly with the audience of reference librarians. There were also concerns that the idea <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandered to students<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now even an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article on the topic in the chronicle of higher education<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There&rsquo;s a quick response to the article <!-- raw HTML omitted -->over at Hidden Peanuts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Gypsy Librarian has a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->response to a similar article about floating reference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with some differences in the way the program was implemented. The idea of reference as cheap security probably won&rsquo;t go over well in many places.</p>
<p>Whether desks disappear completely or not, I&rsquo;m not sure. I do like the idea that it is more of a collaboration then authoritative in the pod set-up. It&rsquo;s probably easiest to sum up the views with that of the ACRL debate:</p>

      <description>John Udell has a few requests for catalog vendors, including making it easier to search by ISBN and for related ISBN&amp;rsquo;s. Peter Murray commentedthat the url should probably be a bit more restful and mentioned PatREST. Talis responded that it would be quite simpleexcept for the xISBN which could cost a lot with large number of searches.
Everything sounds like decent suggestions though I&amp;rsquo;d like to see many more REST interfaces built into the ILS.</description>

      <description>Sifting through the 200+ starred items in Google Reader I meant to blog months ago. One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked about Amazon was the versioned web-service. When they add features or change the structure your old application is still safe, presuming you&amp;rsquo;ve specified the version your using (I&amp;rsquo;ve made the mistake of not doing so). Adam Kalsey has a nice short post on versioning Web Servicesand why it is probably a good idea.</description>

<p>But what happens when something completely changes or an offering completely ends such as the recent change where Yahoo Photo&rsquo;s closed down in favor of Flickr. There&rsquo;s a post over at Jeremy Zawodny about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decommissioning a web service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the comments are worth reading.</p>
<p>If your library is looking at offering an API or Web Service for patrons or other libraries to build on top of it is probably worth thinking about what will happen when you change things or stop a service altogether. Even if it&rsquo;s a proof of concept there is a likelihood that someone will end up using it and basing things on it. I&rsquo;ve found myself getting emails for things I turned off not knowing anyone other than me knew they existed.</p>

      <description>A short article on a study on how many terms users added versus the controlled vocabulary chosen for pieces of art. The discussion centers around the findability of items where 70% of the terms people use are not present. Usually the debate in libraries revolves around the noise or organization issue and seems to ignore the findability. Controlled vocabularies will always have their place, especially in inventory control. But for search and finding aids, folksonomy may play an important role.</description>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t already follow Adactio I recommend doing so, especially if you have interest in social and/or semantic web stuff including microformats. He goes over solving issues with existing microformats with the example of death date which vcard doesn&rsquo;t have. Instead of adding a field he uses hcalendar instead for the dates. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of possibilities for catalog screens using hcard and hreview until a hcite comes around. I think the hcard and hreview would probably catch most of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wesabe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a site i like alot. You upload your financial data and then tag, edit and rate things. There are community contributed tips that match up with vendors and tags which are quite helpful. They now have a REST API for the data you upload (which can be automatic) which means you really have an API to all of your financial data which could be a boon. I haven&rsquo;t had time to play with it but I think there will probably be some cool applications coming out.</p>

<p>Casey has a good post about libraries not taking advantage of the network. I&rsquo;m still a bit unpleased most consortia don&rsquo;t have a web-service that would allow local catalogs to include results. Screen scraping sucks and the consortia probably loses half its usefulness by not having it.</p>

I recently accepted the position of System Administrator at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ann Arbor District Library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision as I wasn&rsquo;t actively looking for new employment, but sometimes you have to take opportunities when they come. I&rsquo;m still impressed daily by the culture and innovation present here.</p>
<p>Many of us in the technology area of AADL are fans of open source software and work with it every day. I&rsquo;m hoping to post more often about some of the technologies and solutions we&rsquo;ve found. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John has in the past<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There is now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a page that lists the software/code we have released under the GPL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In a similar vein we&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soft lauched a developer blog on the AADL site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve posted a quick one about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->using IRC for staff communication<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Expect more in the future once I actually get time. I also suggest reading some of the other posts from our great IT team. If your an III library you may want to glance at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glen&rsquo;s Library Card Expiration Notification Script (and sonnet)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful to get more information and documentation about the code up in the near future as well as possibly svn/bug tracking for it so there is a little more community and feedback than just some static tarballs. I personally believe there needs to be more sharing of knowledge and expertise between libraries, technology-wise, and others seem to feel similarly. If anyone has suggestions for what they would like to see please feel free to drop a line.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably see some more &ldquo;official-ish&rdquo; posts over on that blog with my personal opinion remaining here in all it&rsquo;s glory.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another interesting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interface idea from Well-formed data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a tag comparison flash-based view that allows you to see how your tags compare to the rest of the community.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Wesabe&amp;rsquo;s Data Bill of Rightsbefore. John Battelle has now posted on his formulation of a bill of rights:
Some of the rights he lists are:
The ability to tell what data is stored is probably one of the easier ones to provide but John points out the more difficult point of possibly showing what else is derived from your data such as recommendations. You can likely easily see what items you&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed in the OPAC or Worldcat, but seeing how OCLC or the library has used that data in recommendations or relationships may be more difficult to portray.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some of the rights he lists are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ability to tell what data is stored is probably one of the easier ones to provide but John points out the more difficult point of possibly showing what else is derived from your data such as recommendations. You can likely easily see what items you&rsquo;ve reviewed in the OPAC or Worldcat, but seeing how OCLC or the library has used that data in recommendations or relationships may be more difficult to portray. How much detail is important? It would probably be easy to list the systems that use the data and how they use it. Giving people control over it may be more difficult (I want to review things but not included in recommendations, etc.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is probably one of the first things I look for. I&rsquo;ve put effort into too many new sites without any way of getting my information out in a usable way. One of the main things I worry about with the move to some &ldquo;social catalogs&rdquo; is that patrons will have a difficult time getting the information they put in, out. Can they export their reviews and ratings? Can they build applications on top of their data or even do the basic blog widget? Even a feed with decent data would be helpful for some sites. IMDb and Netflix could use some help in that department.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ability to remove information, permanently, should be offered. If you offer to keep patron history then patrons should have the ability to remove everything, or specific items. I think this is especially important in the age of the patriot act. Patrons may want the benefits of recommendations, reading lists, etc but want to remove specific items for privacy reasons. If your going to offer opt-in services then opt-out should allow the ability to completely opt-out including removing old data.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With libraries being privacy-centric, the ability to opt-out (or most likely not being automatically set as opt-in) should probably be a no-brainer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I touched on earlier, if you are building services on top of the data then there should be easily read information on how the information is being used. This is a good idea in that you also let people know the benefits of opting-in and may have a higher rate of people using the feature. Recording checkout history may look more appealing once they know the various services that use the information. Having the drawbacks listed would also be nice. I personally think any data recording checkbox in libraries should probably be accompanied by a snippet/warning about the patriot act.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Listed as the ability to sell your own data, this is probably easily summed up as not taking ownership of your patrons information. Leave the ownership with them, granting yourself rights to use the data with their permission.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Probably another more difficult (more time and effort) one to implement. Depending on the system there&rsquo;s probably quite a few things you could do. Allowing only certain others to see your reviews, private/public tagging, etc. Something to keep in mind when thinking about the system. I believe there was quite a bit of debate around del.icio.us finally enabling private bookmarks and the for: tags. There&rsquo;s trade-offs involved.</p>

Google has entered the offline app area with an opensource browser plugin called Google Gearsthat allows web applications to have an offline mode. Google Readeralready has this mode. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing gmail will probably follow as well as the office apps.</description>

      <description>Google has a previewavailable of their mapplets along with some documentation. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of the weatherbug mapplet:
With the custom markers and search form available it may be interesting to throw together a mapplet for worldcat or a local consortia, plotting the libraries that carry the item and possibly status if available. You could probably do color coded markers to give a quick glance of status. Maybe someone with more time than me will mock something up.</description>

Digitizing works from Internet Archive right now. It will be interesting to see how this compares to similar work with Mechanical Turk. There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious question which they also answer:
There&amp;rsquo;s been various discussion on captcha&amp;rsquo;s and their accessibility. There&amp;rsquo;s also a nice discussion about reCAPTCHA over at Ben Maurer&amp;rsquo;s blogProps to edsu for bringing up the link again.</description>

      <title>Sad State of Events</title>

      <guid>https://ryaneby.com/2007/05/sad-state-of-events/</guid>
      <description>One the great things about libraries are the events some hold, be it author talks, workshops or movies. Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather disappointed by the way events are presented on most library sites. Some don&amp;rsquo;t even feature or list them on the homepage which is a shame. There are some other things I think would be nice or just possibilities.
Many are starting to use blog software so have RSS but few have iCal.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One the great things about libraries are the events some hold, be it author talks, workshops or movies. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve been rather disappointed by the way events are presented on most library sites. Some don&rsquo;t even feature or list them on the homepage which is a shame. There are some other things I think would be nice or just possibilities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many are starting to use blog software so have RSS but few have iCal. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MSU Libraries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recently migrated to using the campus event calendar which adds those features. If your university has an events calendar you might see if you can create a sub-calender for your events. If you use Wordpress I believe there are a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->few plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that allow you to assign posts to a specific date and will create iCal feeds for you.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While your adding iCal support you might as well add <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hCalendar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Links to Google Calendar shouldn&rsquo;t be hard, but I think it would be nice to go the extra step of using things like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Upcoming API<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (one example) to post event information on external sites like upcoming.org. You could potentially use upcoming.org as your events manager and then use the iCal files or API to put the events on your site. Another bonus is it&rsquo;s integration with Flickr using machine tags. If you store the upcoming ID locally you could probably pull in the images to your events site using the Flickr API. Flickr and Upcoming are just two examples, there are quite a few event sites out there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While I never really got into using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (probably because I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in what others were doing), I think it might have potential here. I&rsquo;m sure you already know but the description for twitter is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While some libraries are posting their RSS to twitter I think it probably makes more sense to post events and post soon before they happen. So say 15-20 minutes before an event starts you have a message sent to twitter saying its about to start and maybe another saying its starting. If I&rsquo;m walking around town, get an SMS that something is starting, I can think about stopping in. Seems semi-more useful then just posting random news.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While probably not as easy as the above, it would be nice to see more events featured on catalog pages if they are related. For example author talks or signings. You could probably extend it to subjects if you have a lot of workshops. If you have pictures or video of an author talk, why not link or embed it in the catalog page (while trying not to make the view too busy). Of course you can link to holdings on the event page as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And since we&rsquo;re on multimedia it would be nice if more talks were digitized (rights permitted of course) and available online. You not only let those who couldn&rsquo;t make it see it, you also show what kind of services your library is providing that people might not be aware of.</p>
<p>Overall I think there is plenty of room for improvement and events might be an overlooked area with all of the talk on the catalog. If you have any ideas, feel free to share.</p>

      <description>I read 2600 once in awhile as it usually has a few decent articles on barriers and how to get around them. Its also nice to see what people are using or playing with. In the recent Winter 2006-2007 issuethere was an article titled &amp;ldquo;Library Self-Checkout Machine Exploit&amp;rdquo;. If you get a copy I suggest browsing through it.
The gist is that because on some (all??) machines the barcode is scanned from the top and the book desensitized from the bottom you can abuse it to desensitize books your not checking out (stack the books).</description>

<p>The gist is that because on some (all??) machines the barcode is scanned from the top and the book desensitized from the bottom you can abuse it to desensitize books your not checking out (stack the books). You then take the books that are checked out which of course sets off the alarm. You have a receipt that shows them checked out and eventually get out. Someone else takes the desensitized books out separately.</p>
<p>Probably not an issue with RFID but something to look out for if you have the machines and people start setting the alarm off with a bunch of checked-out but not desensitized books.</p>
<p>This is basic enough that it has probably been posted elsewhere many times before but figure I should post it just in case so libraries are aware.</p>

You can have the best people in your support team but if they can&amp;rsquo;t get the information they need. I have to deal with quite a few interfaces where I&amp;rsquo;m not completely sure the information I&amp;rsquo;m getting is complete, useful or accurate.</description>

As someone who has worked in support for many years, I can&rsquo;t stress some enough:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can have the best people in your support team but if they can&rsquo;t get the information they need. I have to deal with quite a few interfaces where I&rsquo;m not completely sure the information I&rsquo;m getting is complete, useful or accurate. With a single application it&rsquo;s a little easier then having linked SIS and other systems but it would be nice if a single support system was in place. If your building something that you may need to support or administer in the future, keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Carsonified <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has a post on this as well<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ability to see or track stats is nice. If nothing else, the ability to export stat information would be useful. A lot of the systems I deal with don&rsquo;t give much useful information so it&rsquo;s difficult to tell who exactly we&rsquo;re serving, how we&rsquo;re doing, etc. We keep external stats right now to make up for this but it would be much more time and money savings if the systems did it themselves.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not sure a giant book, but context and inline help. As he says, ideally it results in zero support tickets or the ones that really really need help. Quite a few problems can be fixed with better directions on the screen or better error screens to help recovery.</p>

      <description>Via the Bokardo blog:
The article he wrote on Brain Sparkstalks about some of the benefits that include more data and trust.
I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of room for experimentation with social features but you need to have some ideas and research behind it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few just add a feature because they could. I think Beth Jefferson and the BiblioCommonscrew have put in quite a bit of research and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in seeing how it pans out.</description>

If you were at Code4Lib 2007 then you were probably beat over the head with Solr. If not then here is a very brief intro. Solr is currently an incubator project of the Apache Foundation, part of the Lucene project.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: Many of the examples below only include screenshots. As these are development versions I don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm them with traffic. If you pop in #code4lib you&rsquo;ll probably be able to get a peek at them.</p>
<p>h3. What is Solr?</p>
<p>If you were at Code4Lib 2007 then you were probably beat over the head with Solr. If not then here is a very brief intro. Solr is currently an incubator project of the Apache Foundation, part of the Lucene project. The brief intro from &ldquo;their site&rdquo;:http://lucene.apache.org/solr/:</p>
<p>bq. Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java search library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, and a web administration interface. It runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat.</p>
<p>While that sums it up, it really doesn&rsquo;t tell you how truly useful it is. To begin with Lucene is a powerful full-text search engine. Solr builds on top of Lucene to add a plethora of features that make building search-centric applications much easier. Many of the projects I feature below are one-person spare-time projects which likely would have been more difficult to accomplish without Solr. Some of the features Solr provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to do all operations, including submitting new documents, over HTTP requests (GET and POST)</li>
<li>XML data format (both input and output), making it easy to parse in many programming languages</li>
<li>Ability to easily index a single field in multiple ways</li>
<li>Hilighting of search terms in results</li>
<li>Faceting of results</li>
<li>Query-time boosting, meaning multiple interfaces with different results can be built on same index</li>
<li>Lots of caching and replication features</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the &ldquo;people who use it outside of libraries&rdquo;:http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers include CNET and the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>h3. A Live Example</p>
<p>To start off with a non-library example, here is some information about &ldquo;Internet Archive&rsquo;s&rdquo;:http://archive.org/ change &ldquo;to solr&rdquo;:http://www.nabble.com/INTERNET-ARCHIVE-goes-SOLR!-tf3129097.html</p>
<p>After two days with Solr they averaged about 5.4 queries per second on an index of approximately 575k+ items. Even with this type of load they were able to do it with a single 4GB RAM dual core machine (instead of the 3 they used before). They also averaged a 0.5 load with sar showing 80% resources idle.</p>
<p>As for their index they updated it every 15 minutes and didn&rsquo;t really optimize it other then the schema. Most of the Solr install was stock and they even did their boosting on query-time. An example of their query parsing &ldquo;is given in the email announcement&rdquo;:http://www.nabble.com/INTERNET-ARCHIVE-goes-SOLR!-tf3129097.html</p>
<p>h1. Some Library Examples</p>
<p>h3. David Walker&rsquo;s Solr Experiment</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Walker, &ldquo;who has been working on many things&rdquo;:http://public.csusm.edu/dwalker/, threw together a Solr catalog built on Innovative Interfaces data exports. Specifically he took tab-delimited data exports and imported them into Solr. He then wrote a PHP5-based interface to his Solr instance. While proof-of-concept right now there is hope that it might become something and possibly experiment with union catalog interfaces.</p>
<p>He also used Amazon data for the images and some review information on the item record page. One of the things that caught my eye was the item record view itself:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One of the challenges is getting live status information into the catalog. An easy solution is to just link to the vendor supplied catalog for the item pages. The solution here is to actually scrape the MARC view of the III catalog which supplies both the item information and it III&rsquo;s case, the status info. This is then parsed to allow custom layouts to be created. The example above includes some Amazon data in addition to the normal stuff.</p>
<p>h3. Ross Singer&rsquo;s Solr Experiment</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This Solr instance is interesting in the fact that it has more then just catalog data. While it has around 750k+ records in it, the records come from DSpace, the library catalog and EAD Finding Aids. He hopes to add Subject Guides and databases (e-resources). Dublin Core was used as a possible crosswalk and alignment of the disparate data. This leads to plenty of experimentation with ranking and display of information. It will be interesting to see something like this go live.</p>
<p>As for stats the development version was built by 1 person (Ross) mostly over a weekend. The instance runs on a 2GHz windows workstation. The interface is written in Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>h3. Fac-Back-Opac</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This project is actually hosted on Google Code &ldquo;so you can download it yourself&rdquo;:http://code.google.com/p/fac-back-opac/ if you want to play with the interface. It is written in python with Django. From the project page:</p>
<p>bq. The faceted backup OPAC project began with Casey Durfee&rsquo;s Open Source Endeca in 250 lines or less presentation at the code4lib 2007 conference, where he claimed to provide faceted features similar to the Endeca and AquaBrowser experiences using Solr and Django.</p>
<p>Again the project is running on modest hardware, a standard PC with 1.5GB of RAM which is also running DSpace. In my testing it was quite responsive.</p>
<p>h3. Project Blacklight</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You can &ldquo;read more about Project Blacklight at Bess' Blog&rdquo;:http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/?p=75 and here&rsquo;s a short description from it:</p>
<p>bq. We need significant data cleanup and rationalization to make the facets user friendly. But overall, I&rsquo;m impressed with what we&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish in a few months, with no offical committment of staff time, using only our spare time, borrowed hardware, and good will.</p>
<p>There is also a link to a demo at the blog. I suggest checking this out as it uses a similar interface to that of &ldquo;NINES' Collex&rdquo;:http://nines.org/collex. What I&rsquo;m talking about is the idea that everything is a facet, including your keyword. This means you start with the global facets already shown. You can add facets to limit things down, invert them to remove certain items and add keywords as additional facets. This makes it easier to do some more complex operations where you have some things excluded and some limited, without knowing the boolean or logic behind it. When you foray into the idea of using user-contributed or user-specific data, then it grows even more powerful. I could have the catalog show me things that were only in a certain location that matched my keyword that I hadn&rsquo;t checked out before or isn&rsquo;t on my current to-read list.</p>
<p>I still think it&rsquo;s a rather complex interface and can have a small learning curve to take advantage of all the features but it will be interesting to experiment with it to see how easy it can be made or how well people warm to the idea.</p>
<p>For the stats people there are 3.7 million records and..</p>
<p>bq. The marc records are indexing through a ruby script Erik wrote, directly from marc, without transforming into marc xml first. The box it&rsquo;s all running on is a development server, with four medium fast CPUs and 3.5G of RAM. Solr is running through Jetty, Blacklight is running on a pack of four mongrel instances, with apache doing load balancing out front. Sessions get written to a mysql database, and we use capistrano for deployment and versioning. And it sends us all an email every time an error gets generated.</p>
<p>h3. Rob Casson&rsquo;s Experiment</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Rob has also been playing with Solr and you can see the now familiar facets. He&rsquo;s also experimented with adding things like Refworks Export and item marking. One of the nice things about Solr is that it takes care of enough that it leaves time to experiment with the interface itself. Rob has also experimented with browse views using facets:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting use of facets and similar to that of Collex and Project Blacklight, though it gives different starting point interfaces for the different paths. Something to mess around with. For the stat people, this was a two-person job with Rob using the help of his Authority Control Librarian to help clean up the data and experiment. It&rsquo;s about 2 million records and mostly default install.</p>
<p>h3. Dave Pattern&rsquo;s Experiment</p>
<p>Dave is also messing around with Solr and was able to get something basic up in a couple hours of work. Be sure to &ldquo;check out his blog&rdquo;:http://www.daveyp.com/blog/index.php/archives/202/ for info on his trials. I played with it briefly but haven&rsquo;t had a chance to do much with it. Link to a demo is there and I believe he plans on releasing the Perl source.</p>
<p>h3. Conclusion</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives you an idea of what people are playing around with and that it&rsquo;s not something you need a 20-person well-funded team to accomplish. Play around. There&rsquo;s plenty of people on #code4lib that are playing with Solr although I&rsquo;m sad I haven&rsquo;t had the time yet to do more then interface experiments.</p>

      <description>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know May 5th this year is National Homebrew Day, also known as Big Brew. It is actually a holiday recognized by congress, despite some states still being a little anti-homebrewing. Many clubs and breweries organize brewing demonstrations with the nationally chosen recipes. There is also a simultaneous toast at noon Central Time, though I think we missed the timing last year with all the brewing going on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been under the weather for the last week or so. The random weather here in Michigan isn&amp;rsquo;t helping. It looks like it might be warming up more permanently now, although the greenhouse says they expect one more cold snap (so aren&amp;rsquo;t selling an vegetables yet).
The garden will likely have to wait but I was able to get rid of a few eye sores. There were about 4 stumps in my girl-friend&amp;rsquo;s yard as she had some dead trees that were becoming a liability.</description>

<p>The site includes the now normal things like tagging, comments, playlist, favorites, etc. It has a very del.icio.us feel to it. You can&rsquo;t add lectures directly it appears but you can suggest things to be added. I presume as a sort of quality control for the time being.</p>

      <description>From youtube:
The Zimmers will feature in a BBC TV documentary being aired in May 2007. Documentary-maker Tim Samuels has been all over Britain recruiting isolated and lonely old people - those who can&amp;rsquo;t leave their flats or who are stuck in rubbish care homes. The finale of the show is this group of lonely old people coming together to stick it back to the society that&amp;rsquo;s cast them aside - by forming a rock troupe and trying to storm into the pop charts.</description>

      <description>I noted before the discussion on machine tags. Another example has come about with Revish, the book review community, pulling in images from Flickr that use the book:isbn=********** tag. An example page is Bulletproof Ajax. From their blog:
The cookbook and knitting are interesting examples that probably give an idea of what&amp;rsquo;s possible. For example I could tag something with book:isbn, book:page or something similar and have images of what a dish actually looks like.</description>

<p>The cookbook and knitting are interesting examples that probably give an idea of what&rsquo;s possible.

I could see quite a few crafty communities use this to add value.</p>
<p>And for those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Revish, they bill themselves as a place for reviews and not a competitor to places like Library Thing. From <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the faq<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you want to catalogue your book collection I encourage you to go look elsewhere. Here, just follow one of these links and sign-up there (but come back here to write reviews): LibraryThing, Shelfari.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an API coming out with reviews appearing to be under a Creative Commons license. This may come in handy for libraries looking to add some content but who are wary of Amazon&rsquo;s terms. From what I&rsquo;ve read they also leave rights with the review authors, outside of non-exclusive reprint rights. I&rsquo;ll definitely be interested in seeing how the site goes.</p>

Users are able to create their own maps and mark them public or private. The annotation tools that are provided are very simple and easy to use. Users are able to add lines, polygons and placemarks. They can edit those placemarks with HTML, images, and video. Once a map is created it is very easy to share it and syndicate it via KML.</description>

<p>Users are able to create their own maps and mark them public or private. The annotation tools that are provided are very simple and easy to use. Users are able to add lines, polygons and placemarks. They can edit those placemarks with HTML, images, and video. Once a map is created it is very easy to share it and syndicate it via KML. Items found during a local search can be added to a map with a click. Places found via GeoRSS or KML files can also be added to a map.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->try it out on the maps site presuming you have a google login<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I played with it and it worked fairly easy. While not a competitor to probably most mapping offerings I can see it taking the place of some of the simpler map sharing services. Tt might be simple to create mapped pages for library collections or exhibits without doing much programming with this new service, and with the export methods use it for your own mashups. Here&rsquo;s an example they have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of oral histories of Route 66<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But as O&rsquo;reilly points out what is really interesting is that the search now includes georss and kml sources that have been indexed. Meaning that if you share a map or geocode material on your website, it&rsquo;s quite possible that your locations/information will show up when someone searches the map. As he puts it:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have digital collections with geodata here is something you might want to look into.</p>

      <description>Once referred to as &amp;ldquo;tripletags&amp;rdquo; supposedly but now called Machine Tags, due to Flickr&amp;rsquo;s adoption of their use for geocoding, etc. From machinetags.org:
While still using the tag name, it&amp;rsquo;s slightly more controlled and has some interesting potential. While their main use seems to have been the geocoding your probably familiar with, others are beginning to expand it&amp;rsquo;s use to pull information from various API&amp;rsquo;s into their software or sites.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But what you&rsquo;ll probably find more interesting is the discussion of book tagging:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adactio has a nice follow-up article on the use of machine tags<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with flickr and blog posts, including the benefit of having custom namespaces:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also a nice post over at geobloggers about some of the possibilities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And if your an RDF fan there&rsquo;s the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->poor man&rsquo;s RDF<!-- raw HTML omitted --> post you may find worth reading.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Those is libraries are probably familiar with namespaces and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->info uri&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Maybe they&rsquo;ll be submitted as a namespace on machinetags.org, who knows. Another <!-- raw HTML omitted -->similar use is that of &ldquo;dctagging&rdquo; by Pete Johnston<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (thanks to edsu for the link):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>dctagged dc:creator=Berners-LeeTim<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Presuming the API&rsquo;s are decent, I can see quite a bit of potential for pulling together data from disparate sources for augmenting records and other data. A library&rsquo;s flickr photos of an author&rsquo;s visit can be easily shown on record pages in the catalog.  A work with geo-location data could not only be mapped but also have photos and events from modern day. While there are other ways to accomplish the same thing, machine tags have the potential to make it somewhat easier and use a larger community. I think it would be interesting to see what data could be added to the view of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WorldCat Identities<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if dublin core machine tags started being used. Photos, online texts, etc.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts, I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to playing with them yet. And if you didn&rsquo;t notice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Maps now supports GeoRSS sources<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s well worth reading the comments about the difference between server-side and client-side and the freedoms each allow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not at the point where I can probably write eloquently on the issue, but if you have the time I recommend reading the above and following links. &lsquo;Open&rsquo; in any form is becoming more and more important whether it&rsquo;s source, data, access or identity.</p>

      <description>For those that work with RDF or similar you may be interested in these:
RaptorRaptor is a free software / Open Source C library that provides a set of parsers and serializers that generate Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples by parsing syntaxes or serialize the triples into a syntax. The supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Triples, Turtle, RSS tag soup including Atom 1.0 and 0.3, GRDDL for XHTML and XML. The serializing syntaxes are RDF/XML (regular, and abbreviated), N-Triples, RSS 1.</description>

<p>Getting RDF data on the web can be hard to convince people to do, or to do correctly (see RSS). This service helps convert formats as need be and lets you access embedded RDF via GRDDL (such as microformats when they have a transformation) without the need to pre-process it yourself.</p>
<p>Triplr is built on Raptor and lets you convert formats between each other through a simple GET interface including JSON and RDF output from RSS, etc.</p>

      <description>Found a couple tips on Ted Husted&amp;rsquo;sblog. He recommends deleting the old tag and then doing another tag as trying to overwrite will do a merge. And so to have it for prosperity here is the command to change the log for a revision:
$ svn propset &amp;ndash;revprop -r 504523 svn:log &amp;ldquo;WW-1715 Branch for 2.0.x at Struts 2.0.6-SNAPSHOT r504196&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve used mod_python to serve trac and got ok performance, but my installs weren&amp;rsquo;t public. On Code4Lib it was set-up as a fcgi install. This worked ok but was extremely resource intensive.
I also host through TextDrive and found that they recommend running Trac through Tracd and then proxying the requests through apacheif you want it on the normal port. I went ahead and tried that on code4lib.</description>

      <description>A ways back I looked into supporting campus authentication in some apps I was brainstorming and found the information rather lacking for our campus. It was also only IIS supported at the time which made me feel a little less secure about the whole thing. They now have an apache module and are working on single sign-on but I&amp;rsquo;ve scrapped any plans.
However, I am rather impressed by what CASE is doing.</description>

It was also only IIS supported at the time which made me feel a little less secure about the whole thing. They now have an apache module and are working on single sign-on but I&rsquo;ve scrapped any plans.</p>
<p>However, I am rather impressed by what CASE is doing. You can start by looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a wiki page they have describing their system<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and yes, the wiki even supports the CASE logins. You can also see that they have perl, ruby on rails, drupal, zope and other modules available. With choices like that I would not be surprised if their adoption rate is rather high.</p>
<p>What led me to the wiki was that they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->now offer OpenID&rsquo;s for anyone with a CASE login using the single-signon system<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And from the posting:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see people in academia playing around with identity and authentication like this. However, a commenter did point out the first thing that popped into my head:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here at MSU faculty usually keep their NetID and students have it for around two years after graduation. It will be interesting how universities and colleges handle this type of policy as people start linking their identity with the university itself. It&rsquo;s also a place that needs work for OpenID consumers. I&rsquo;ve now lost the quote but someone made the comment that one of the crucial things missing is that consumers don&rsquo;t allow multiple ID&rsquo;s to be associated with an account, which would help prevent problems if one provider disappears, etc.</p>
<p>Something to think about. And to academia, here is a nice example of central services and information that can be useful. Transparency and documentation is a wonderful thing.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m way behind in lots of things right now but I might as well post something. The keynote on the first day of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code4Lib 2007<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was by Karen Schneider who writes at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Free Range Librarian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, among other places. You can view a video of her <!-- raw HTML omitted -->presentation on google<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and download links should be available soon on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->code4lib presentation page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The presentation is well worth watching and I think was well received, despite a few hecklers in the crowd.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Karen began with an overview of where we are and what&rsquo;s wrong. Currently we&rsquo;re often giving away our collections, leasing information from vendors and publishers without actually keeping anything ourselves. This is a topic that&rsquo;s come to my mind many times when we have access problems to resources. A good chunk of our collect can disappear in minutes and it&rsquo;s often outside the library&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>A second point she made is that we are dependent on external tools as well and don&rsquo;t build our own. The tools that we do have are needlessly complex and poorly marketed. I&rsquo;ve had this argument with quite a few people and it&rsquo;s hard to convey why the complexity is often needless. I hope more get it. I&rsquo;ll probably devote more posts to this topic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll devote a separate post to this topic as I believe it&rsquo;s really important but I&rsquo;ll include Karen&rsquo;s point that libraries don&rsquo;t have lots of patrons, they have 1.5 patrons and 1.6 million hostages.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Something I need to think more about, but Karen pointed out that libraries are really in the business of memory work and that libraries often don&rsquo;t recognize the business they are in. Preserve and provide access to cultural memories. This is important to keep in mind when you think back to the emergency things are in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The 5-3-1 rule of Karen&rsquo;s is to find 5 issues that are important, focus on 3 and make 1 happen. Five issues that important are standards adoption, digital preservation, crappy library software, 3rd party content and scholarly awareness of issues. The focus was preservation, software and awareness. The one thing those in the room could definitely make happen was the crappy software. Examples of some of the good things coming out were Evergreen, Umlaut, Scriblio and Solr.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Karen stressed the importance of building solutions within the library. The reasons she gave was that it restores the balance of power, reinstates the direction of the profession, puts emphasis on the memory work and sends a message that we can do it and libraries matter. Other outcomes include decoupling, re-use of external projects (wordpress, etc) and re-socialization with external parties.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Opac is the last thing anyone but librarians want to use. Karen&rsquo;s comment was that it &ldquo;was easier to ask their mothers for the answer&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some generalizations made were that no one really cares about open source, just the experience, that ARL count has too much drive in planning, IT directors won&rsquo;t take unfunded initiatives and most libraries can&rsquo;t provide developers.</p>
<p>Directors want to know:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Directors often thing that open-source projects are lower quality, developer oriented, have no support model and are one beer-truck away from orphan software.</p>
<p>Projects need to keep this in mind when trying to get adoption. The current Evergreen project site was used as an example of where things could be improved. In my talking with the Evergreen crew they agree completely. I&rsquo;ve also been checking out open-source library projects myself to see what&rsquo;s out there and I can confirm that most of their sites convey very little useful information for someone making decisions and not actually installing it. Don&rsquo;t presume people have already decided.</p>
<p>There was a comment about if free software was free, price vs freedom, etc which was met with some debate. I&rsquo;ll leave that for another post.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another topic I&rsquo;ll probably write more on. She referred to it as biblio-creature-feep, the tendency of last-gen librarians to love systems that are needlessly complex that have to be taught to people but use comments like &ldquo;our users need it&rdquo;. Some ways to counter this is with analytics, usability tests, ethnographic studies, etc.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally, every library needs a developer. Karen points out that there was a time without ILL and reference librarians and now developers are just as important as those. Libraries should keep that in mind.</p>

<p>I can attest that the CastingWords process is pretty nice. They seem to have done a good job from a glance through (I haven&rsquo;t read it yet) but then I haven&rsquo;t listened to the original. But if they manage to get &ldquo;COinS&rdquo; right then there must be something good going. So without further ado here are some downloadable versions:</p>

<p>Hi, this is Jon Udell. My guest for this week&rsquo;s podcast is Dan Chudnov. He is a programmer who has worked on library information systems at MIT, at Yale, and soon at the Library of Congress, where he will be starting a new job shortly. This conversation is kind of a sequel to an earlier one with Tony Hammond of Nature Publishing Group. Tony talked about how digital object identifiers are being used in the world of academic publishing to create a stable, long-term framework for persistent linking and reliable citation.</p>
<p>There is a related technology called OpenURL that plays a role in academic publishing, but it is also something that Dan Chudnov are approaching from the perspective of libraries, that need citations to be not only durable and persistent but also to be able to redirect into the holdings of a particular library. It all sounds kind of esoteric, and in a lot of ways it is, but these questions of digital archiving and persistent linking will matter more and more, because we are all creating the library of the future.</p>

<pre><code>  Why don't we kind of start there, from the perspective of the various library-related linking and resource-identification standards that you have been involved in. So if you could sort of back up and state the problem first, in a way that everyone could relate to, that would probably a good place to start.

<pre><code>  You want to be able to follow the references, essentially, and see which giant's shoulders they have been standing on, and verify that these people are building on the right combination of work when they are proposing a new idea or a new solution to a problem.
  
  Part of that is simply verifying that their statement of problem is accurate and they know what they are talking about; and the more important probably, progressive aspect of that is being able to verify scientific results and claims. So you need to be able to follow people's references if you want to do science.
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Basically, what you want to be able to do if you are reading an article online, much like you would want to do if you have a physical copy of the paper, is when you are looking at the references you want to go and follow those references. You want to find which journals, which issues, which volumes, which pages these references people are citing, are relevant to your understanding of the problem you are trying to understand with the author's perspective.
  
  So, you literally need to go into the book stacks, the journal stacks, whatever, and find that volume, that issue, that page of that journal, so you can find the article, and this is exactly the problem as it translates to the Web that led to the development of the OpenURL standard seven or eight years ago. That problem is, you are using an online article, you are reading an article in an online journal, and at the bottom of the article there are a bunch of references.
  
  And the references aren't homogeneous in any way, in the sense that, well, they are probably formatted the same way visually, and there are obviously styles people use to keep that consistent--short form of the author's name, and a title of the article, and a short form of the journal title, and reference to volume, issue, year, page--but that is really hard to translate mechanically online for a couple of reasons. One is that metadata, first of all, is very sloppy. Author names are ambiguous, journal names can be ambiguous, journal names change every time journals split. Book titles are mistyped, misquoted, that sort of thing. There is a lot of slop in the system.

<pre><code>  If we go back six or seven years that wasn't necessarily so at all. This is all actually very recent, that you could assume that most recent things would be online. But they are all published by different publishers, and the different publishers maybe publish the journals themselves on their own sites, or they contract with third parties to publish them for them in their own systems, or there are gateway systems that essentially aggregate resources from a variety of publishers into whole new interfaces.
  
  And when you are working at a big library like Yale University's libraries, not only are you going to have an unholy combination of all these subscription agents and aggregators and source publishers themselves subscribed to in your library, but the resources themselves are going to overlap.
  
  So, when you follow a reference link, what you need to know is whether you have that journal at your library, and not just whether you have that journal, but which system you can use to get to it, and within that which of those systems actually allow you the specificity of naming a volume, an issue, a page, an author name, a unique identifier, and can get you right to that article itself.
  
  What you really want to be able to do is bring people right to the full text of the article with one click. Unfortunately, with all these reasons, it is just not always that easy.

<pre><code>  The identifier aspect of this is one big step in mitigating some of these issues, because if you have a known, unique identifier, you can recognize that as such and have a little more mechanical strength in trying to resolve it to a direct link. A lot of what you talked with Tony Hammond is in that space.

Yes. Other obvious kinds of identifiers are URLs in general, and PubNet identifiers if you are in a medical space, like I have been working in most recently. These are well-known, they are well understood, they are easily recognized, and they are usually fairly easily resolved.</p>
<pre><code>  Now one of the jobs I have had in a previous life was I was wondering on the D-Space project at MIT Libraries about six years ago, and even just the &amp;quot;how to generate IDs and resolve identifiers&amp;quot; problem alone, on that project, was a source of endless debate, and not even... What we came up with isn't even necessarily something that pleases all parties all the time.

<pre><code>  With the D-Space project, one of our exclusive goals was to solve this, and in many ways to support open access publishing by making it easier for authors and institutions to publish their own words by, as much as anything else, not only taking a copy of the content and offering to manage that over time, but also simply offering a stable URL.
  
  If you talked to a number of authors at MIT five years ago, they would line up right away and tell you that, sure, they had been publishing their own articles, but their graduate assistant system administrator had moved on, and the system had been compromised, and now the links don't work, and they have been publishing papers and now no one could get to their articles anymore. &amp;quot;Yes, please take a copy of this for me and give me a stable URL that I can cite.&amp;quot;

<pre><code>  So in this particular sense I think there is an importance to the role of needing some sort of distributed identification resolution stuff, because if all the libraries put their eggs in one basket, with one centralized service, and then anything happened to that one centralized service, that is a traditional single point of failure problem: we simply can't provide the service we need to our communities. So negotiating this spectrum of what you need to centralize, what you need to distribute, is an ongoing and fairly difficult process.

<pre><code>  And that is certainly the problem we can't ignore in libraries, and on that level we have hierarchies of authority and responsibility, from individual responsibility to organizational affiliation to networks of organizations; and in a sense this tapestry that is building out on the 'Net, this thing that is missing, is approximating the complexity of &amp;quot;meet space&amp;quot; that in some sense then maybe it is fully built. In another sense, maybe the tapestry doesn't work unless there are clear overlaps and interconnections between.

<pre><code>  So, in fact, what it looks like happening here is, it seems very similar to what Tony was describing as the query process, going into the DOI and handle stuff, where you want to get back a concise identifier, but you need to ask the system, &amp;quot;What would that be for these values?&amp;quot; Is that a fair statement?

<pre><code>  You are going to be able to go to an open-access copy of it. You are going to be able to go to an aggregated version of it in something like Lexus-Nexus, Academic Universe, that kind of resource, or a gateway subscription service like EBSCL. So you might get several copies of links that are all different, that are all going to take you to versions of the article; and below that you will get links to an interlibrary loan service if you aren't lucky about that.
  
  Now, another project I have been working on, and some other people in the community are trying to improve the step, is basically what you are doing is, not only are you presenting users who typically just want to get right to the full text with this confusing screen offering these options in the middle of which is the full text link, so just take me there darn it. You are also, you are moving users through three different systems at once.
  
  For every reference you want to follow, you need to come up out of the silo of content you started in, which might or might not be the same one you have to go back to a month later to get to the same article; step through the library's user interface; remember how to follow the links in there; and end up at the ultimate site, which might be, again, different from one month to the next depending on library subscriptions, which come and go and change over time as well. And that is really confusing.
  
  Every time one of my colleagues has reported to me, informally or more publicly, on usability testing results from OpenURL screens, the result is almost invariably, &amp;quot;I think I know from this that if I click the first thing I will get to the full text, and I remember seeing it, so I do that.&amp;quot; But they don't read it, they don't remember the different options, because these screens are typically just not that good yet. They need a lot of improvement.
  
  So, a project I am working on now, I have been consulting on this effort called LibraryFind, a metasearch project coming from the Oregon State University Libraries, funded by the State of Oregon. It is a metasearch tool which allows you to search multiple resources at once. We have basically embedded an OpenURL resolver into the result stream, so that when you do a search on someone's name, like yours, or a topic or the name of a book, hopefully what you are going to get are not just links to OpenURL resolver screens--we control the whole system, right? We have got these front-end-to-back-end searches that are licensed resources; and we have got the OpenURL resolver; and we have the knowledge base of which resources were subscribed to.
  
  So, what we are trying to do is reduce it to two clicks. You send your search query to find what you want, and if we can find a link directly to full text we are just going to give you that link right away in the results. So one click to find, one click to get. And when we have done usability testing on this, it is amazing. There is no question what it does. People instinctively want to just click on the result and get the full text of the article when you are doing article searching.
  
  And when we are able to provide that, which is in many cases, people don't even recognize what is happening, because the number of systems they have moved through has been reduced and the number of screens we were confusing them with has gone down.
  
  Of course, this doesn't always work. If you are doing book searching, you are trying to find a book, you are not necessarily going to find an e-book copy. So then we have to move you through data from the online catalogue, and figure out if it is online, and figure out where it is on the shelf and whether it is checked out. These problems just don't go away; there is always a possibility for great confusion. But we are trying to find ways, both through this project at Oregon State and a lot of other initiatives going on, to shorten these steps.

<pre><code>  But on the other end of it, I want to cite this thing, and I want to cite it in a way that is canonical and durable. So, at that point, what does that part of the process look like? Where do I end up with the OpenURL that I want to point other people to?
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  And essentially what needs to happen at that moment is we need to restore metadata, we need a restoring metadata system; and in some cases, certainly when you have things like a reference object that you are passing by reference with an identifier, you can do that fairly reliably. If you have some combination of fields like title and author and pages and publication date, it's a bit more of a crapshoot. But if at all possibly you do want to be able to restore that full record, and in addition to providing a service which would lead people to full text, you do want to provide a canonical citation form.

<pre><code>  We thought about what it would like if you could just track a community's OpenURL resolutions, and just have a stream that would show up, and a feed you could subscribe to, of all the references people are going to over time. And in a lot of ways this is what social bookmarking is: you are reading over people's shoulders, you are seeing what your friends are reading.
  
  What I think hasn't happened yet is for those two areas of functionality to really be bridged. I don't think there is an OpenURL resolver on the market that not only provides full text links and a citation form but also automatically lets you save a resulting citation into a community bookmarking service.
  
  But thinking about those issues led us to this other generic problem, which is, &amp;quot;Well what if I'm--well, I'm working at Yale, which is lucky for me, I'm lucky to be there and they have great resources; but if I'm writing a paper and want to publish it on the 'Net, and I want to blog about it, how do I put up OpenURL links that other people can follow? This is a huge problem.
  
  We have come up with a temporary solution to that. Again, it is another community initiative, and this one is called COinS.

<pre><code>  So, when you think about an object of some platonic form, the surface area of the expressions of that object is pretty diverse. And the more popular something is, the more thorny shapes and little drop outs you're going to have over that topology. One of which is metadata representations of it that is essentially surrogate the in hand copy which you don't have when you're looking at it.
  
  Sort of by definition, there is loss between representing an object through metadata and the object itself. Particularly when it's hard to say what the object itself really is when we have PDF copies and HTML copies, AAC files and MP3 files and so on, and transcripts of the following.

For me to be able to make a similar investment, it's my intellectual life and I take it very seriously and I constantly refer to things in the past that I have written and just the other day I had to try to go back to something in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://byte.com/&quot; &gt;byte.com&lt;/a&gt; archive from ten years ago and already that's problematic.

But also archives exist to take on the papers of important scholars and members of the public sphere and authors, artists and organizations, governments, big companies.
  
  It is the ongoing imperative mission of archives and other libraries to do this work. So, until there is an organization that chooses as it's mission to preserve my bits as an individual, I can't assume that Amazon will or the Internet Archive will because I haven't made that arrangement with them.

After all, your not going to stop the determined regardless of the copy protection you use.</p>
<p>I came across another company that appears to be taking this to the next level for video. The service is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Streamburst<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it allows people to sell their videos online in multiple formats and DRM free. They offer Mpeg-4 versions at both high quality and portable (ipod, zune, etc) and also mobile phone versions. What&rsquo;s nice is that you get them all with your purchase and you appear to be able to download them as many times as you need. Here are the formats:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And of course, since it doesn&rsquo;t use traditional DRM you can play it on any platform that supports Mpeg4. I played the file I downloaded on Windows, OSX and Linux without a problem. I went ahead and bought <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Search of the Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for $8. You have the choice of using Google Checkout or Paypal at this point. Once you&rsquo;ve purchased it you have access to the download which then builds a custom version of the file for you. Here&rsquo;s what the building screen looks like:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the opening screen of the movie file with my name on it:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>They also apparently strip out a unique series of bits from each copy of a file downloaded so as to watermark it, but it should be undetectable. Again this won&rsquo;t deter the determined but is for the &ldquo;casual copying&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think it will be interesting to see if models such as this prevail (presuming some sort of protection remains) and how or if they will handle the lending arena in libraries. Many currently depend on things blowing up after a set amount of time, but some libraries already lend things out on players and this could go a similar route.</p>

      <description>An article from The Chronicle about one professor&amp;rsquo;s experience using Tor on campus:
The Chronicle Review - From the issue dated February 9, 2007
So in the head-on collision between my appreciation of the role IT staff members play on my campus and my understanding of the role I have to play for my students, my need for academic freedom won. I found myself lecturing my three visitors into near catatonia about the uses of Tor.</description>

      <description>There was a post over at Panlibus about find it in Talis links being added to Google Scholar. I have links to WorldCat and MSU so had presumed it was a IP thing. I had forgotten that I had set it up in my preferences. A post over on the Google Librarian blog pointed out the citation export feature.
Well I went ahead and added Talis to try it out and it indeed worked even for someone across the pond.</description>

<p>I think it would be cool if they added various citation formats like ALA, Chicago, etc though I guess getting them into the major programs is a first start. Once they allow me to star items and build lists, I&rsquo;ll be set.</p>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a nice post over at Infomancy about OPACs:
AADL is still dependent on the III based OPAC which I think holds them back quite a bit. It will be interesting to see how they cope or move away from it. Some are playing with Solr and other technologies to make their own indexes, facets and interfaces. There&amp;rsquo;s some trade-offs involved but the control may make up for it.
Another problem I tend to see with the &amp;ldquo;lipstick on a pig&amp;rdquo; type of path is that it is quite easy to go from some mild lipstick to something that looks like a dead hooker from a CSI episode.</description>

<p>AADL is still dependent on the III based OPAC which I think holds them back quite a bit. It will be interesting to see how they cope or move away from it. Some are playing with Solr and other technologies to make their own indexes, facets and interfaces. There&rsquo;s some trade-offs involved but the control may make up for it.</p>
<p>Another problem I tend to see with the &ldquo;lipstick on a pig&rdquo; type of path is that it is quite easy to go from some mild lipstick to something that looks like a dead hooker from a CSI episode. Though not as severe I&rsquo;ve noticed this problem with Amazon and AADL as new pieces are added on. The new features are plugged into an old template and it becomes slightly harder to use. I believe AADL is currently working on a new item level template, I can only hope that Amazon tweaks things after they figure out the plog/wiki/tags/etc then are doing. Here&rsquo;s an example result from AADL (click for larger image):</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I found it rather disorienting as it&rsquo;s hard to see where I actually am. The title of the book gets kind of mixed in though the status is easy to spot. This was probably fine back when you were lucky to get that far in the OPAC but as deep linking becomes more possible it will become more important to be able to tell exactly where you are. This means more prominence to the title and other important information. You&rsquo;ll also likely need to make sure branding and other information is present.</p>
<p>David Walker, from a place warmer then Michigan right now, has been experimenting with a Solr index of his holdings which has allowed faceted search, etc with somewhat more ease than previous options. He&rsquo;s still scraping the MARC view for the item display but he&rsquo;s been able to pull off a simple interface, so far, with a little amazon data added. It will be interesting to see how it pans out once he adds more features.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Another project of his was Xerces which provides an article metasearch. Again the results are quite easy on the eyes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Another nice piece in the screenshot above is the use of simple language like &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have it but&hellip;you can get it in x days&rdquo; which is a lot more useful then some of the screens I see.</p>
<p>Both David and Blyberg are working on redesigns so I have no doubt that some great things will be seen in the future. They also are both working with open systems that will likely allow them to be more agile then they would otherwise. Once of the great things is that AADL can try out new stuff, keep it if it works or tweak it if need be without the time frames or problems that they would traditionally face.</p>

      <description>From over at Christina&amp;rsquo;s LIS Rant:
The google ad&amp;rsquo;s are on the item view screen. I&amp;rsquo;m actually not surprised as the pages are accessible from Google Scholar. I expect more to go this route as they make landing pages for the various open search engines.
This does make me wonder though. Will vendors continue with the subscription model or move towards a pay-per-view only model since they already have it for search engines in the future and can probably make more money?</description>

Will a search engine convince some of them to end the subscriptions and subsidize the change in order to try to pull more people into using their product instead of libraries? Will Google integrate Google Checkout with Scholar for easy shopping or perhaps personal subscriptions? I think there are quite a few business possibilities and libraries aren&rsquo;t necessarily in the picture. I think that concerns me more.</p>

      <description>From ecorrado:
I think moving to open-source could help this in the long run, though the initial costs could be similar. If they contract with a oss vendor then they will avoid license costs and in the long run may only need to pay for enhancements they actually want, meaning less large upgrades just to get a small feature.
However, I do think the real solution may require more collaboration or distribution of cost, maybe even a hosted model.</description>

<p>However, I do think the real solution may require more collaboration or distribution of cost, maybe even a hosted model. I could see similar small libraries pooling resources to fund enhancements that specifically serve their users or pooling together for a combined ILS (with individual interfaces). I think this is similar to some of the stuff Talis is working on (data feeds) and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some vendor offers hosted Evergreen or Koha on a subscription model to help save on the costs of buying hardware.</p>

      <description>Jeremy Frumkin has a nice short article in OCLC Systems and Services:
However, in order to do all of the above, behind the scenes my digital library without golden bars uses all of the expertise and experience of libraries to create a successful user experience. Instead of showing MARC records to users, it uses MARC records to improve search relevancy. Instead of making a user click on a â€œget this itemâ€ link, and then popping up a separate window with information from an OpenURL resolver, it smartly steps ahead and provides a direct link to full text in the search results themselves, based on the information provided by the OpenURL resolver.</description>

      <description>One of the powers of full text, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t present it to users, is that you can build some interesting things on the data analysis. One such tool is mapping of place names in the works. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve previously blogged it but one example is Gutenkartewhich maps locations in texts available from Project Gutenberg.
Well it appears Google is finally integrating maps in with their Google Book search.</description>

<p>There will likely be more to come. However if you&rsquo;ve had experiences building on top of these products or exporting and processing information please leave a comment. If you have experience with another product I haven&rsquo;t profiled please leave a comment here. What I&rsquo;m looking for is export, database access and web service abilities. Also included whether they are base or you had to pay extra.</p>
<p>I am using customer experiences as having a feature does not mean it&rsquo;s usable. In some of the products the lack of documentation can make it difficult or the output may not be valid. Again, if your experience varies please leave a comment. I don&rsquo;t moderate except for obvious spam.</p>

Update: There is a xrecord feature built in that allows the pulling of XML data for a specific record, however I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to get it to list attached items which reduces the usefulness.</description>

      <description>A first post in hopefully a series. Access to data from the ILS has been a common thorn in #code4lib&amp;rsquo;ers sides. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping here to post some of the ILS&amp;rsquo;s that are out there, what data access options they offer and whether they are built in the base or are extra products. I won&amp;rsquo;t bother with costs or other sensitive info.
As the Evergreen crew is on #code4lib and don&amp;rsquo;t appear to sleep, I&amp;rsquo;ll start with them.</description>

      <description>There have been some great projects lately about moving information control into the hands of users such as Move My Data. In that vein there is the idea of profile data using microformats. For example you have a list of your friends marked up on hcard on your blog. When you sign up for a social service then you just input a link to your blog and your friends are imported.</description>

<p>Decentralization and control by the user is also becoming important in the movement for &ldquo;Identity 2.0&rdquo;. If you want a quick introduction then I recommend watching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the OSCON keynote by Dick Hardt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p>For those used to the normal user/password at every site it can be a bit of a hurdle to understand as it involves external providers and trust (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->from Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->):</p>

      <description>News to me but it looks like MS is coming out with a tool to help build e-learning modules (learning objects) named Grava.
There&amp;rsquo;s not much information on the site and I&amp;rsquo;m a little worried that there&amp;rsquo;s no mention of any of the standards such as IMS, common cartridge, etc. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s not just another format like most MS offerings though right now there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a decent spec anyone wants to support anyways.</description>

      <title>Upgrade to ATOM</title>

      <guid>https://ryaneby.com/2007/01/upgrade-to-atom/</guid>
      <description>As I recent posted there was a debate over Netscape&amp;rsquo;s decisionto remove the DTD&amp;rsquo;s for older RSS types (0.9 and 0.91).
One of the outcomes of this decision is that the feed validator will now give a warningif the DTD is linked to. The recommendation is to either upgrade to something else (RSS2.0, ATOM, etc) or remove the doctype and try validating again without it.
If you happen to be using one of those versions, now might be the time to upgrade to ATOM.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already caught it, Outlook 2007 changes html support rather drastically. In fact it appears to go backwards from the last version of Outlook. The change is from the IE rendering engine to the Word html rendering engine. Some are guessing this is related to anti-trust.
Regardless if your library sends out newsletters that are html emails then you may want to test it with the latest outlook to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s readable.</description>

      <description>Here are a couple I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful lately:
A command utility that allows you to fix the MBR while logged into Windows. I moved my linux to another comp and wanted to get the one I was on up and running again. I had neither the windows boot cd or the Administrator password. However the user I was logged in as had Admin rights. Just ran the utility from the command line and presto.</description>

I had neither the windows boot cd or the Administrator password. However the user I was logged in as had Admin rights. Just ran the utility from the command line and presto. Was a lot quicker then going through the recovery console. You can also backup or move MBR records with it. You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->download it here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A single download of all the Windows updates for 2000/XP/2003. It will extract everything to a folder and has a program you run that will search for ones already installed. Also includes some tweaks and registry hacks. This can come in handy if you have a computer that is on a less then stellar internet connection somewhere. Run to the library or somewhere and download the file. You can burn the extracted directory to a CD or copy to a flash drive if it&rsquo;s big enough. The patch presumes you already have the latest Service Pack. If you don&rsquo;t, get that first and then use AutoPatcher.</p>
<p>The only thing I found is that it has all of the patches MS releases for that Windows version and may not be specific for what you have installed. Windows Update showed no updates at all but AutoPatcher had plenty, many of which were for locales, etc that I didn&rsquo;t use. I suppose it never hurts.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really not much of a shopper and I tend to research for so long that by the time I make a decision a new set of products are out. I do most of my shopping online, outside of groceries, and here are some of my favs. I figured I should post it so there is some record on the all-seeing google.
Adagio has some nice loose leaf teas but what makes it worth it is the experience.</description>

I do most of my shopping online, outside of groceries, and here are some of my favs. I figured I should post it so there is some record on the all-seeing google.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Adagio has some nice loose leaf teas but what makes it worth it is the experience. The site is easy to use, has reviews and ratings and also includes some community features. What set&rsquo;s it apart is the experience once you order. You get plenty of tracking on the site, can copy your order to someone at a discount and also send gift certificates to others for free. The unexpected part was when I got an email letting me know it was delivered which included all the info from the tracking service. I was inside my house and didn&rsquo;t even know it was left outside.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A gimmick site. The deal is available only for 24 hours or until it&rsquo;s sold out, whichever comes first. The wine is available for a week it seems. Goes for the impulse buy but they do have some great deals. I haven&rsquo;t actually ordered anything from them but keep tabs in case something on my someday list comes up at a discount.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Still my main shopping location. The addition of affiliate stores has expanded the selection and I find myself ordering many more things. The shipping can get you if your not careful but I&rsquo;ve found I still save quite a bit. I&rsquo;d look into Prime if it was eligible on more items. I&rsquo;ve had great luck with returns which is my main concern when buying online. I also start at Amazon for the reviews and recommendations even if I don&rsquo;t buy it there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Amazon of computer parts. I&rsquo;ve bought nearly all of my computer components and accessories here. Great prices, lots of reviews and I&rsquo;ve had great service with returns. With the large and fanatic user base you get a lot of detailed reviews that let you really trust the product your buying.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is where I buy all my green coffee beans to roast them at home. They also have roasted coffee which is pretty good. Their reviews of the beans and information on homeroasting is great. Their site could use some more organization but it&rsquo;s worth finding the info.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More browsing then shopping, but some great hand-made items. Also has a nice community. Great if your looking for some unique items.</p>

      <description>A new semester and some new problems. The first is Windows Media Player 11. Not yet out via Windows Update so not a huge problem but with the coming release of Vista I think it will be.
I think it was reported in a few places but WMP11 seems to have removed support for the MMS protocol. You can see a chart showing this on their network protocol kit page. It says that it can be used as a rollover protocolbut that doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to work, at least not in my testing though it may be a server configuration issue.</description>

<p>In my testing I had to change the URL in the ASX file to specify RTSP as well as remove any port statements. The file then worked in WMP11 thanks to Helix serving it on that protocol as well.</p>
<p>A rather abrupt change as most streaming servers appear to use it for windows media files. We got kind of lucky here as Helix will stream the file over rtsp or http without too much problem. The hurdle is changing the ASX file generation it does on the server to include the proper link.</p>
<p>If you have streaming windows media files you may want to check and make sure they play on the latest WMP.</p>

      <title>Easy Wordpress Upgrades with SVN</title>

      <description>I came across these hints in some comments on blogs but don&amp;rsquo;t have them bookmarked so credit to other people. This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a supported install method either, so use at your own risk. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it easier than the normal process though.
You may be aware but Wordpress uses Subversion and Trac for their development. This means you can check out the source which means you can also easily upgrade your source.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across these hints in some comments on blogs but don&rsquo;t have them bookmarked so credit to other people. This probably isn&rsquo;t a supported install method either, so use at your own risk. I&rsquo;ve found it easier than the normal process though.</p>
<p>You may be aware but Wordpress uses Subversion and Trac for their development. This means you can check out the source which means you can also easily upgrade your source. There&rsquo;s two ways you can do this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The current branch appears to have the upgrades. What you do is checkout the branch with the revision of the last tagged release. When an update occurs then you can checkout that revision. Or you can just update to the branch and you will get the beta&rsquo;s and release candidates for releases of the branch. Probably not as stable but I didn&rsquo;t have any problems.</p>
<p>Note: I did have a problem with the branch as it pulled in the akismet plugin from svn that didn&rsquo;t seem to work. You may want to remove it from svn on your local install or install it manually.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another option is to checkout the latest tag. When an update occurs then you do a svn switch to the new tag.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->svn co <a href="http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.5/">http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.5/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->svn switch <a href="http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.6/">http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.6/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve been doing this for the 2.0 line and haven&rsquo;t had a problem. Made the process much easier then copying files and hoping I remembered everything.</p>

      <description>Or at least the possibility of some in library-land. I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown around the idea back when code4lib&amp;rsquo;ers were discussing the possibility of a non-profit status for the group, that it might be worthwhile to build some web services/APIs for various things libraries could use such as records, relationships, artwork, etc. Nothing came of it but it looks like I don&amp;rsquo;t have to bother with the records anymore. I missed it in the initial release but from a Open Libraries post:</description>

      <description>One of the things I hated about gaming was the CD checks. I&amp;rsquo;d usually have to go through hoops and cracks so that I could take the computer places without hauling tons of CD&amp;rsquo;s that would likely get swiped.
It was nice when Valve changed over to the Steam platform(though it has plenty of problems). Now you can install the client on to whatever computer, login and the games you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased show up.</description>

<p>It was nice when Valve changed over to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steam platform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (though it has plenty of problems). Now you can install the client on to whatever computer, login and the games you&rsquo;ve purchased show up. You can download the full game to the computer without ever touching a CD.</p>
<p>This is also occurring in the subscription world as there is really no need to have a CD when you need to login online anyways. In fact you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->now download the full World of Warcraft game<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (all 3+ gigs) online for free using Blizzards torrent-based downloader (which can also be problematic and/or slow). I&rsquo;ve actually done this twice for computers in different locations as the CD&rsquo;s are somewhere in storage (currently moving).</p>
<p>Overall I think it will help the gaming industry save some costs and also probably make some more sales. It will be interesting to see if more consoles go the online platform route. The ability to just login and browse the games you have available, easily purchase them and then have them available to play soon after. Many already have harddrives so there is really no reason not to do this.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of researching information on services to distance learners since that&amp;rsquo;s my primary job focus. I personally think there is more then plenty of room for improvement. The research seems a bit sparse as most articles focus on teaching and pedagogy over other services. What I did find is that many of the researchers find that universities focus on the core services (enrollment, payment) and library access but drop the ball when it comes to other services that might help build a bond between university and student or help students do their best.</description>

I&rsquo;ve searched MSU for some of the non-core or often forgotten ones to see how we fare.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My overall impression is that there may be quite a few services available to both on-campus and off-campus students but they aren&rsquo;t easy to find if they do exist. Others would like require multiple phone calls just to find out. I&rsquo;m hopeful that this can be fixed in the future.</p>

      <description>Leaving the ILS vendors out of this one. You may have noticed that the Similepeople made a modified dump of their catalog available as a data set in RDF, MODs, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few people in code4lib that are doing experiments with library data and who also believe in the concept of Open Data, so torrents were madeto help share the information.
Well fast forward and the dump has been removed with the reason of &amp;ldquo;We are currently evaluating legal issues about ownership and licensing possibilities and hope to be able to be back online with it soon.</description>

Due to this the tracker for the torrents was also shut down.</p>
<p>While nothing is known for sure the debate arose in #code4lib that this may be related to the lack of concrete information on who owns the records when 3rd party records are used such as OCLC&rsquo;s or LoC&rsquo;s. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OCLC has some guidelines up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but it was debated whether that was a legal license and it was also debated whether LoC is public data being a government entity. The only thing that was agreed on was that it would likely take better statements from the 3rd parties or a legal case to make those who work with this data feel safe.</p>

I try to keep tabs on my money and have managed to stay out of debt for most of my young life, including credit card debt. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a lot of programs including MS Money, Quicken, KMoney, GnuCash, etc but all left me wanting.</description>

<p>I try to keep tabs on my money and have managed to stay out of debt for most of my young life, including credit card debt. I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of programs including MS Money, Quicken, KMoney, GnuCash, etc but all left me wanting. I just wanted something simple to tell where my money was going. I ended up not using all of them after a week or so.</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m only a couple weeks in but I&rsquo;m liking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wesabe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more and more. Because of the social nature of the site it has a little more pull then just plain software. Users can share tips and goals which are attached to tags or merchants. When one of your transactions match the information for a tip or goal then it displays a link in you transaction log. You can also comment on tips or create your own for a specific merchant. There are already quite a few on gas, saving on groceries and vendors like Amazon. Many of the tips have a nice debate in the comments about what works for some and not for others.</p>
<p>Some of the features I like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was hesitant to use the site as I take privacy, security and my data seriously (though I&rsquo;ve had lapses). With financial data I&rsquo;m even a bit more wary and in fact I initially tested the site with information from a closed account. I&rsquo;ve now moved up to using the site fully and feel at least some trust. What I like is that:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As libraries move into the recommendation and discovery area they will likely keep more data around. Add to that user-generated information and you have a privacy and data concern. I think it will be important to look at sites like Wesabe and see what they are doing.  Can your patrons easily read and understand your privacy and data retention policies? Can they delete all of the data easily? Opt-out of aggregated data? These are important questions that should be answers prior to turning on the latest opac feature.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and then also makes the statement:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really see much evidence of &ldquo;better results&rdquo; in the article and I haven&rsquo;t seen it in real life either. Some of the arguments that I&rsquo;ve seen include that the article misses the social aspect and the &ldquo;wisdom of crowds&rdquo; as well as having an either-or mentality when they could augment each other. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From dystmesis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from Catalogablog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a commenter disagrees<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the paper has an either-or position:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I agree with some of the arguments for strict classification and that there are problems with tagging en masse, though I agree with others that there is probably a critical mass where useless tags get washed out. I don&rsquo;t agree, however, that using relative meaning is inheritently bad or invalid. In terms of discoverability and findability, all possible interpretations can be helpful. It can also provide context for works such as ones which had a political reason for being published even though the work itself was not about politics. I think the most useful benefit of tagging is the relationships between items that can be made apparent through the interpretations. I do agree, however, that there will also be the need for controlled vocabularies in organizations.</p>
<p>It might be my background in science that plays a roll.  With the advent of genetics it became apparent that some classifications were probably not correct, though it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to change. And whether controlled or not, some decisions in classification can be arbitrary. And when you get down to some systems what something is or isn&rsquo;t turns into a statistic and the idea of duality becomes easier to fathom.</p>
<p>In the end I think both systems do an ok job though I tend to find more with tags on sites such as LibraryThing, though this might be the display and not the classification at work. Having more than one &ldquo;classifier&rdquo; means that the results can be weighted depending on how many have tagged it such.</p>
<p>I guess I can&rsquo;t end without an example. On Worldcat, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1984 has only two subjects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which include London fiction and Totalitarianism. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibraryThing has some overlap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but adds things such as dystopia, political fiction and social commentary. Sure there are some erroneous tags in there but the popular tags are quite useful, especially with creating the &ldquo;similarly tagged&rdquo; items which give decent recommendations of relatedness from a quick glance. Similar to Worldcat&rsquo;s results for the totalitarianism subject though with likely a bit more weighting. In the end, both are useful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to point out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dystmesis also has a nice writeup on folksonomies and LibraryThing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s worth a read.</p>

As with most things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Art<!-- raw HTML omitted --> plans, it was worth the time. I&rsquo;ll probably be posting some more about some of the ideas that came about there but here&rsquo;s a brief run-down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks to detroit traffic and a hotel without parking, I missed the continental breakfast. There was plenty of coffee left thankfully. The even then started with a presentation by Art (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->slides<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). He used some analogies such as cars. Cars have become increasingly complex but have a support structure (diagnostics, etc) that have evolved with them. ILS&rsquo;s have gotten complex but have no such structure. He then went on to talk about the importance of evolution in library systems and not reinvention. He also decried the lack of metrics in many library areas. We know things are wrong but we don&rsquo;t really know much detail about what&rsquo;s really going on. Art&rsquo;s a big proponent of using specialized components and hooking them together. Many businesses are moving from monolithic to specialized software that talk to each other (more from pmurray later). Accounting has accounting software, not an accounting module hacked together for the sprinkler system. There is good software out there for acquisitions and workflows, why not use them and spend the effort on making great systems talk to each other. The general take-home message he had was that the backend needs work too, not just the opac.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Following up on Art&rsquo;s ideas on the backend was Peter Murray&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talk on SOA in libraries<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve read on SOA but haven&rsquo;t really kept up as I should. His main focus, that at least I picked up on, was the componentization of the ILS. Having discrete software that is specialized and have open protocols or paths for them to talk to each other. It fits well with the ideas Art has on using outside software and I also think such an architecture may be needed to allow rapid changes in workflow or collections, like the rise in ERM. There seems to be some work around NCIP and other ideas with some of the opensource ILS&rsquo;s that may help support such an architecture in libraries. I won&rsquo;t try to explain much else, browse <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pmurray&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you want more info. There may be better or alternative models, i&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was nice to finally see a presentation about Evergreen instead of just the blog and other reading. The talk revolved around the history of the project and the challenges they faced. It was interesting to see their requirements and what they did to resolve them. Solid engineering work. The system architecture was really nice to see and the amount of redundancy was more then I expected. The storage system does appear to be a weak point but that appears to be common these days with some businesses moving to Amazon S3. It was also impressive to see that they were able to overcome the political issues, such as global library policies, which I think likely kill many consortia ideas.</p>
<p>I think an important take-home is that they had very special needs and demands which most vendors aren&rsquo;t going to support just due to the business case. This is the prime area where home-grown and open-source solutions shine as the modifications or building can be done in house. Having an architecture that allowed them to do feature-requests in a day didn&rsquo;t hurt either. The reviews of the consortia project are good and I can only expect them to grow with the new software. Some links:</p>

<p>I then ducked out of the symposium to talk with Beth Jefferson of Bibliocommons. I&rsquo;ll save that for another post.</p>

      <description>Some brief searching on Google Local over at SEO by the SEAfor major libraries brought up some disappointing results. I&amp;rsquo;m not overly surprised with the findings.
If you run a Library, I believe that you can submit information about your library to the Google Local Business Center even though it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a &amp;ldquo;business.&amp;rdquo; That may help information about your library show up correctly in Google Local listings.Another problem we have here is that many buildings don&amp;rsquo;t have real street addresses but instead name the address after themselves.</description>

<p>Another problem we have here is that many buildings don&rsquo;t have real street addresses but instead name the address after themselves. The library is 100 Library and the Administration building is &ldquo;Hannah Administration Building&rdquo;. All mail is processed by the university so it is just as easy to sort by building then address but as you can imagine even if you know the address there can be major problems mapping directions. I&rsquo;m sure this choice made sense when the central mail delivery was designed but with online maps and GPS becoming popular it&rsquo;s becoming more problematic. I&rsquo;ve had multiple calls for street addresses to put into their car GPS system only to have to tell them there is no real street address. I usually had to find a nearby intersection or try to use Google Maps and some browsing to find something resembling lon/lan coordinates. Not fun.</p>
<p>I think in the future when people choose locations for new buildings or expansion, the ability to easily map the location will become more and more important in the decision making process.</p>

      <description>The Inquiring Librarian has a nice post entitled More Structured Metadata. She puts nicely what I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to say or maybe have said in the past. There really is a need for some good structured metadata in addition to what is already in the catalog. Ideally you&amp;rsquo;d have full text to also work with but for now that will be unlikely. Perhaps as the Google and other projects go on the libraries involved will be able to share metadata or API&amp;rsquo;s for metadata that libraries who hold the items can use.</description>

Perhaps as the Google and other projects go on the libraries involved will be able to share metadata or API&rsquo;s for metadata that libraries who hold the items can use.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think automation will become increasingly important and automation might not be the best label. I think this category includes API&rsquo;s and various other methods of resource sharing. Pulling ratings and descriptions from Amazon, relations and recommendations from LibraryThing and other services will help the catalog become more usable even if the metadata isn&rsquo;t used in the search index itself.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t touch on her other points but I will agree that more consistent and structured data could help with some of the discover problems. For her example of geography-based recommendations I think a good real-world example would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gutenkarte<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and that&rsquo;s only one way of doing it. Again that&rsquo;s dependent on having full-text or at least a controlled word list available.</p>
<p>In the realm of Amazon integration I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Athens County Library<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Koha-based) is a nice example. The data is not really used in the searching but when seeing whether an item is for me I have the reviews and more right within reach. Hell, some even have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interviews with the author<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. All free and easy to use thanks to useful API&rsquo;s.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another area is tags and the like. While there are arguments against the &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; and &ldquo;wild&rdquo; metadata, I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile just for the possible relationships and recommendations that can be made based on them. You also get the added ability of allowing reading lists, class lists, reserve lists and countless other uses that can come out of it. When using most catalogs I find the subject headings to be near useless, though that&rsquo;s mostly an interface problem as you can&rsquo;t often do intersections. Even if I could though usually there isn&rsquo;t enough of them to narrow anything down.</p>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a nice resource called ANTS (ANimated Tutorial Sharing Project)which hopes to create screencast tutorials for library resources that libraries can share and use.
Recognizing that creating and updating Tutorials for each online resource is a daunting task for any library to undertake on its own, librarians in COPPUL got together to find a way to share in their development. This project is an outgrowth of that initiative and our goal is to create a critical mass of Open Source Tutorials for online resources used by libraries everywhere.</description>

There&rsquo;s not much there yet but this definitely looks like a worthwhile idea. The wiki is nice though I&rsquo;ve never been overly enthused when coming across Dspace but you have to shove the stuff somewhere.</p>
<p>I think it would be nice if the screencasts were uploaded to YouTube or Google Video so that libraries can easily insert them into their pages. We&rsquo;ve thrown around the idea here about doing screencasts for some of the things for distant students and faculty. I&rsquo;ll have to keep this project in mind.</p>

<p>I had to restart Firefox to get it to show up in the preferences. The third way is even more involved and requires editing the user.js file in your profile directory. You would add the following lines:</p>

      <description>I recently updated by Debian testing box and it appeared to upgrade python to 2.4. Since then when I went to my Trac install and went to browser it gave an error that &amp;ldquo;no module named svn&amp;rdquo;. With googling I found multiple places that went the route of manually installing svn and trac. Luckily I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go this route. All I had to do was:
apt-get install libapache2-mod-pythonI run Apache 2 and this uninstalled the mod-python-2.</description>

<p>Code4lib 2007 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into a conference-ish format. It is <em>the</em> event for technologists building digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software. Code4lib 2007 will be held from February 28 through March 2 in Athens, Georgia.</p>
<p>Prepared Talk Information</p>
<p>Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must center on &ldquo;tools&rdquo; (some cool new software, software library or integration platform), &ldquo;specs&rdquo; (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; (One or more big problems we should collectively address). We will evaluate proposals on criteria of usefulness, newness, geekiness, and diversity of topics.</p>
<p>Prepared talk proposals of 75 words or less are being accepted for review now. Please send your name, email address, and proposal to: <a href="mailto:code4libcon@georgialibraries.org">code4libcon@georgialibraries.org</a>.</p>
<p>We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with ample opportunity to show off. Lightning talks are 5-minute presentations that any conference attendee can sign up to present.</p>
<p>The proposal deadline is November 13, 2006, and proposers will be notified by November 20, 2006. Voting on the proposals will be public, and held in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->similar fashion to SXSW<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>An interesting comment system over at Jack Slocum&amp;rsquo;s blog that uses the Yahoo UI kit with Wordpress. It allows you to comment on any &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; which includes paragraphs, headings, images, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this done in other systems but I do like how it&amp;rsquo;s handled here. A similar interface was thrown around for commenting on articles in public access journals and possibly a code4lib journal if it ever occurs. Would be a nice addition to some of the Open Journal System layouts.</description>

      <description>Besides brewing my own beer, I also roast my own coffee. I find that it&amp;rsquo;s rather cheap compared to premium coffee with the added benefits of letting you choose the roast level, try many varieties and have actual fresh coffee. The green coffee beans keep quite well so you only need to roast what your going to drink while it&amp;rsquo;s fresh.
I buy my beans from Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;swhich has a nice selection and takes homeroasting seriously.</description>

<p>There&rsquo;s two main, cheap set-ups for homeroasting which include a hot popcorn popper or a rotisserie basket on a gas grill. You can also buy commercial roasting machines but the alternatives are cheap and do a good job. I personally use the popcorn popper and am currently building a rotisserie. I was going to write-up some directions but found a nice YouTube video that goes over the process instead. I do have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some pictures up on flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>Recommendations and relevency can be big business. Netflix is offering a prizefor someone who improves their recommendations based on sample data. Datamining has the potential of helping libraries increase relevency and help people find books that might interest them or even just relationships between items. However, there is a big privacy issue involved when doing this. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice talk on google video regarding how to handle some of this that might be worth a watch for those involved in this field.</description>

      <description>A couple of ajax-type web apps have added &amp;ldquo;infinite scroll&amp;rdquo; implementations. The infinite scroll being that when you get near the bottom of the results page it dynamically loads more results. There&amp;rsquo;s no real paging, just loading.
The two apps I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in now are the new Google Readerwhen viewing a subscription and the new A9when viewing search results. Supposedly Live.com Search has/had this but doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to do it now in Firefox.</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea for certain results area or large data sets where it might be useful to add in additional data as needed. I&rsquo;m still not completely sure on the usability side of things. In the examples above I find the scrollbar jumps around if I&rsquo;m not holding the mouse down. It also caught me off guard the first time. An interface idea to keep in mind though.</p>

      <description>For my lounge time I&amp;rsquo;ve taken up the pipe to go with my homebrew and liqour. A bit easier on the senses then a cigar. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to have a quality pipe shop near by that does some nice local tobacco blends. I only have a few pipes but it is a lifestyle in itself.

<p>For my lounge time I&rsquo;ve taken up the pipe to go with my homebrew and liqour. A bit easier on the senses then a cigar. I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have a quality pipe shop near by that does some nice local tobacco blends. I only have a few pipes but it is a lifestyle in itself.</p>

      <description>Came across this via SuperPatron. It looks like AADL lends out street mapsfor people that are going on vacations and the like. I think this is an interesting service as a lot of times it&amp;rsquo;s a waste for someone to buy a map when they will only be there for a few days. Could also probably ask for donations from those who have. Probably fairly cheap for the gas station type ones compared to USGS.</description>

<p>I believe my library is non-circulating for all of the maps. At least the website gives that impression.</p>

      <description>I had used Book Burrobefore but didn&amp;rsquo;t find an easy way to add libraries, so instead tried out LibX. That&amp;rsquo;s changed now as they&amp;rsquo;ve added WorldCat support, which our library participates in. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t give status information but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice quick glance at least.</description>

      <description>I went ahead and tried out CrazyEgg on some pages I had thrown together. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few things that could probably be tweaked or changed. It was easy to get some quick data as some of my coworkers have the page as their homepage. I have to say it was really easy and non-obtrusive. Just a simple javascript tag that&amp;rsquo;s inserted.
If your doing testing of different designs of sites it might be worthwhile to use this to see what people are clicking on.</description>

It was determined that many libraries and related fields are playing with Lucene and it would likely be worthwhile to have some sort of gathering. Some notes:

<p>While the discussion centered around problems it was decided that it would likely be worthwhile to have something at either SuperConference or Code4Lib. The idea of an &ldquo;install fest&rdquo; would also be useful where people would bring in a computer or have access to a remote server and they would be walked through getting a lucene/solr install running and possibly moving some of their data into it.</p>
<p>I then jumped on the road and back to america for some more beer.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first real session was hosted by some of Elsevier&rsquo;s skunkworks developers. It was really nice to see that a vendor like Elsevier has a developer group (although small) that gets into the quick prototyping and idea generation stuff. This presentation was on the adaption of Scopus to include local results. Here are some highlights:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The presentation was interesting but probably the most to those who are working with distributed indexes as the project met quite a few problems included local vs global ranking and indexing differences.</p>

      <description>The co-author of Lucene in Action, this presentation could probably have been termed a keynote. Erik is working with Lucene and Solr in quite a few projects and some of the displays are fairly interesting. Most of these projects are listed under patacriticism.orgthough there is another called Juxtawhich also used Lucene though mostly for data analysis.
There was more information in the presentation but I found it hard to summarize some of it.</description>

<p>There was more information in the presentation but I found it hard to summarize some of it. I really found the Collex interface concept to be very interesting. Everything is a contraint or limit and you can easily add or invert the contraint. It&rsquo;s also easy to add things to a personal collection and parts of the personal collection then become facets/contraints themselves. He&rsquo;s really using all of the metadata (archive and user) to it&rsquo;s full extent. He also has more plans including &ldquo;exhibits&rdquo; where people can &ldquo;curate collections&rdquo;. These collections themselves can then become objects in the index and so on. This project will be something to watch.</p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been hoping to see Karen present and this was another reason to go. The presentation focused on the change of LII to Lucene which is still forthcoming. Some notes:
While my notes are short it was a worthwhile presentation, especially if you were doing testing of products. The upcoming LII looked quite nice and they went with a commercial product built on Lucene rather then roll their own which was a nice difference from the other presenters.</description>

The above is just a small overview and if your looking for a presenter for a conference I would definitely suggest Beth. Really got the brain juices flowing.</description>

      <description>An interesting outreach mechanism for on campus. The ASU libraries set-up tents around campus with signs for anyone that was lost or had trouble finding the class. Also gave out bottled water. One way to show your presence on campus and a little more useful then the usual tent that asks you to sign up for a credit card to get a t-shirt (common here at state).
Be sure to check out the full photoset on flickr.</description>

      <description>Alan has a nice post on his library&amp;rsquo;s hopes of changing how reference is provided. They hope to move away from the reference desk and move more towards a &amp;ldquo;pod&amp;rdquo; approach which I understand to be more open and allow patrons to sit right next to the reference librarian for help. No more barriers between the librarian and the patron. It will be interesting to see how the design turns out and what tweaks they make.</description>

First, the submissions to Talis&#39; Mashup contest are in. Art has been working on a Google Desktop mashup and he has a nice writeup about it now.
Planning for a free web-conference called Five Weeks to a Social Library is underway. They are requesting proposals for presentations currently. Led by a great group of people and likely to turn out just as great.</description>

<p>In my past genetics studies it has been brought up about some of the gene flow between microbes and humans. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Via Jon Udell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I know find out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->90% of the cells in the human body are microbial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p>The joys of government works and the public domain. Someone is taking the time to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->digitize the FSI language courses and offer them online<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p>And finally some more security posts showing that the weakest link is often the human one. It appears that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some fraudsters have been able to get a pizza phone line forwarded to another phone, which then then use to collect credit card information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. AT&amp;T of course, but I guess at least the NSA has records of it all.

      <description>Seed Magazine has a coming issue on the 25th anniversery of HIV/AIDS and of the XVI International AIDS Conference. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to get my library to subscribe (great science magazine) but they have a lot of coverage online. There&amp;rsquo;s some nice infographics in a recent post and some other great posts as well.
There quite a few posts on the scienceblogs referring to the anniversery. I recommend taking a look around.</description>

      <description>Alan Gray has a post on his new blog(subscribe now) about Library 1.0 vs Library 2.0.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been harking on policies and other non-technology problems lately. I must point out, however, that the attempts to implement some of these tools are helping shed light on some of the problems. Some could argue that changing to be more customer service oriented is Library 2.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve been harking on policies and other non-technology problems lately. I must point out, however, that the attempts to implement some of these tools are helping shed light on some of the problems. Some could argue that changing to be more customer service oriented is Library 2.0 and a major change. My counter is that your just farther behind and really need to fix the Library 1.0 things as well and they should probably have higher priority. Having blogs and other outreach won&rsquo;t help considerably if there are active policy barriers preventing people from using the library. Alan also touches on the fact that these changes can often be done quickly and have immediate affects, unlike some of the longer planning cycles related to technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to Alan in the past and his library has some great ideas and I&rsquo;m expecting that they will likely be used as an example of good practices more and more. I feel more and more shame for not being able to make it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Library Camp East<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you even can remotely swing it I recommend trying to attend. My funds just don&rsquo;t allow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that it&rsquo;s the communication with patrons that matters, not the use of blogs themselves. You can throw together tons of blogs, flickr accounts and other tools and not really accomplish anything when it comes to customer service. Identify your problems and then see what technologies or solutions fit.</p>

      <description>If thwarting open-access wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, it seems that access to electronic form of classification systems is quite prohibitory. Tim writes over at the LibraryThing blog about his research into classification systems, and why he&amp;rsquo;ll likely have to go with little known classifications to do what he wants. I personally found it rather surprising that such data was that hard to get. I can see the charging for value-added services such as customized clients and workflows but keeping the data itself behind walls was a bit more than i expected.</description>

<p>There&rsquo;s some talk in the comments on whether LC can prevent others from providing the data since it&rsquo;s governmental and should be open. Regardless the post and the comments are worth a read.</p>

      <description>Continuing from my previous post, here are some more topics from 37signals&#39; Getting Real ebook. All quotes are from the ebook and again I recommend giving it a read.
Many libraries believe they need to be Amazon or Google or they&amp;rsquo;ll lose out. This misses the advantage libraries have of being smaller. They can offer a more personal service to the community. A library can offer one on one reference help, community workshops and outreach that others can&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

<p>Many libraries believe they need to be Amazon or Google or they&rsquo;ll lose out. This misses the advantage libraries have of being smaller. They can offer a more personal service to the community. A library can offer one on one reference help, community workshops and outreach that others can&rsquo;t. Someone browsing the web at the local coffee shop may be able to search Google, but they likely won&rsquo;t have the chance of asking a question to a real person, that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unless your library is there<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Most libraries are part of a community, they should probably take an active role in it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As in any profession, libraries have jargon. There&rsquo;s things like &ldquo;serials&rdquo;, &ldquo;circulation&rdquo;, &ldquo;ILL&rdquo;, etc. Though it can often save space to use umbrella terms, if it prevents people from finding services or the resources they need, it is likely worthwhile to explain exactly what is being offered.</p>
<p>Knowing what terms people use and think of can also be useful. I often get calls from students who are told by professors to look for &ldquo;peer-reviewed sources&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary material&rdquo;. They are not aware that journals or indexes may be a place to look for them, as there is nothing on our site that says &ldquo;peer-reviewed&rdquo;. The use of primary in this case also tends to be different then what is considered primary on our site. This is usually where a reference librarian would come into play, but if the question is common it may also be a place for other outreach. Maybe it would be a good idea to prepare an &ldquo;evaluating resources&rdquo; handout for professors to give to students (including reference contacts), that breaks down the various sources they should use and how to find them at your library. Or maybe it&rsquo;s a sign that things should be reworded or a link to a guide should be made more visable. If your main audience is students, then common tasks and research guides should likely be moved to the forefront. If the majority need to start in indexes, then it will likely be worthwhile to make it easier to find and more apparent that it&rsquo;s a good starting point.</p>
<p>Keep up to date on what terms people are using when they ask questions and use them to your advantage.</p>

      <title>Libraries Thwarting Open Access</title>

      <description>Open Access News provides an english translationof some of the main points from a german post on how german libraries are thwarting OA.
The first point is that &amp;ldquo;only a small number of library journals are OA&amp;rdquo;. This has multiple points, including whether they should be offering open access and whether or not they actively promote open access. There have also been some posts about this in regards to the ALA.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Access News provides an english translation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of some of the main points from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a german post on how german libraries are thwarting OA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The first point is that &ldquo;only a small number of library journals are OA&rdquo;. This has multiple points, including whether they should be offering open access and whether or not they actively promote open access. There have also been some posts about this in regards to the ALA. Here are a couple to read:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A second point is &ldquo;libraries promote toll-access bibliographical databases&rdquo; which may also be the case here. Most libraries will see it their mission to provide access to resources, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s open-access or restricted. The question arises of whether they should actively promote resources that are open-access. We&rsquo;re doing some here but it could probably be much more. With the attempts to educate about &ldquo;the scholarly crisis&rdquo; there is really no excuse not to. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dchud touched on this in regards to the ILS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but it is really applicable to any contract-based or non-OA offering.</p>
<p>Some of the other points include that eprints include licenses that aren&rsquo;t applicable and that copyright is applied to OAI metadata itself. One of the ones that stands out is that libraries being members of organizations (Germany&rsquo;s JSTOR according to this article) works actively against OA and in effect promotes &ldquo;the scholarly crisis&rdquo;. Something to think about.</p>
<p>I also think there is another point which wasn&rsquo;t mentioned which is the support of DRM&rsquo;d material. Most take on the argument that it&rsquo;s a vendor interoperability problem. &ldquo;If only apple supported this format&rdquo; or if only everyone could support one format. That misses one of the points of DRM which is lock-in to specific platforms. Apple has their itunes/ipod, Sony had their own custom ones that never took off and Microsoft had one they tried to spread but even they are moving to a similar system as Apple with their new Zune. It just tends to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hurt everyone but the platform provider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s possible that a standard could come about but whether anyone would rush to support it is another thing. eBooks is an area where this problem is present and libraries should be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->happy to see some vendors trying to do it without DRM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and hopefully support and promote the efforts.</p>

Check out his YouTube profilefor more of his content and to see how quickly he&amp;rsquo;s adapted to the technology. Are any libraries helping document local stories?

      <description>Library Stuff has another post on worldcat and borrowing policies. I still believe that a policy rethink is in order, but I think WorldCat could provide some warning similar to &amp;ldquo;Library policies differ and you may not be able to checkout this item directly. Contact the library to find out more&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, but more thought out.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is just a WorldCat problem though. As more and more OPAC&amp;rsquo;s become searchable and findable online, it&amp;rsquo;s likely worthwhile to put some sort of policy statement right on the OPAC or the record display to prevent confusion.</description>

Some brief explanatory text of policies or a link to an explanatory page that&rsquo;s easy to spot could help quite a bit. I found policies to be difficult to find in many of the library sites I checked. Even a simple &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have a library card? Call xxx to see if your eligible&rdquo; would be a start.</p>
<p>As for being anonymous, it wasn&rsquo;t on purpose, and i&rsquo;ve been meaning to create some sort of about page. One day.</p>

It did not take much investigating to follow that data trail to Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow who lives in Lilburn, Ga., frequently researches her friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ medical ailments and loves her three dogs.

First is news that AOL released a data set of users&#39; searches on purpose. The data was partially anonymized but since some of the searches can be identifying in themselves it&amp;rsquo;s possible that this might turn into a privacy fiasco for them. There also seems to be reports that there&amp;rsquo;s sensitive data such as social security in it. If you do search analysis or other data mining, think long and hard how to anonymize and protect data.</description>

<p>The second is about using feeds as vulnerability vectors. I believe this was presented at blackhat but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a PDF with information is available<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is nothing ground breaking as most aggregators use browser engines to display the information, similar to some email clients. Aggregator clients that run locally on a machine may also be considered to be in a less restricted zone. Something to think about if your building aggregators or parsing feed. As always you can&rsquo;t trust everything that&rsquo;s given to you. And as always be careful about what you subscribe to, as you would with email.</p>

      <description>A post caught my eye over at Library Stuff about patrons that may find something in OpenWorldCatand head over to the library in question thinking they&amp;rsquo;ll get the book, only to be greeted by this:

The post goes on to recommend OCLC design something so that patrons don&amp;rsquo;t see things from libraries they can&amp;rsquo;t borrow from. I disagree to a point. I think if a patron is willing to drive to your library then there is really no good reason to deny them, especially if your a public institution.</description>

<p>The post goes on to recommend OCLC design something so that patrons don&rsquo;t see things from libraries they can&rsquo;t borrow from. I disagree to a point. I think if a patron is willing to drive to your library then there is really no good reason to deny them, especially if your a public institution. I think the problem lies more in the libraries then in OCLC&rsquo;s offering. Here at Michigan State we allow anyone in Michigan to get a library card. We are also part of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MichiCard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> program which, among other things, makes us agree to not charge other member library patrons for the privilege. We don&rsquo;t charge anyone as far as I know. After all, these are people who pay taxes. Multiple other universities and colleges are also part. I do question our policy of not lending CD&rsquo;s and DVD&rsquo;s to community borrowers, however.</p>
<p>I can see the arguments some have for &ldquo;serving their immediate community&rdquo; better, but it might be time to re-question what our &ldquo;immediate community&rdquo; is, especially in the light of a networked world. Our library does get calls from other countries and we can&rsquo;t serve everyone. I usually use this as a point to education about ILL programs. That said, I think there&rsquo;s very few people who actually come through our doors that would be sent home empty handed.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s just me, but it seems odd to see lots of libraries talking about how to increase usage, serve patrons and make themselves more relevant but then also see them turn away people who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actively want to use their library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just seems backwards to me.</p>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article in the latest EDUCAUSE Quarterlythat&amp;rsquo;s available online. The article goes over the podcasting pilots at University of Michigan&amp;rsquo;s School of Dentistry.
One of the first findings was that most students seemed to prefer audio over video, which they attribute to being more portable. This is despite the students actually originally requesting video, which shows that it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile doing more indepth studies like this. This was a good thing, as moving to audio only provided a large reduction in staff time.</description>

This is despite the students actually originally requesting video, which shows that it&rsquo;s worthwhile doing more indepth studies like this. This was a good thing, as moving to audio only provided a large reduction in staff time. They also looked at different ways to record the audio, including students with ipods. They found that a computer hooked to the PA system provided the best audio for the price, however.</p>
<p>The second thing they did that I think is worthwhile looking at is automating the process. They made it so students could record the lecture by double-clicking an icon on a computer. Once the lecture was over the student stopped it, entered some metadata, and the program took it from there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They also studied distribution methods. The files were provided in both MP3 and AAC. About half used each, with those using AAC preferring it due to the ability to bookmark and speed up/down the audio. For those that may be confused, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AAC is a standard codec<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not one by Apple (Apple added a DRM layer to AAC for the iTunes store).</p>
<p>They provided these files via a centralized website, course websites and RSS. They found the centralized site was preferred as well as RSS (true podcasting).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some other points made include Intellectual Property and faculty buy-in. They chose to put the podcasts and audio files behind authentication. Integration with Sakai may also come out of the project and includes interest by Apple.</p>
<p>The full article is worth a read if your looking into podcasting in an elearning context or otherwise.</p>

      <description>Dchud has a nice post about using OCLC&amp;rsquo;s resolver APIto integrate other institutions&#39; resolvers with your application. The end result being that any user that comes across your site would be able to find it locally if they have an institution IP. One step closer to what I think Dan&amp;rsquo;s OneBigLibrary idea might be. Rosshas also played with the idea in his metasearch/resolver and the idea opens some possibilities for users.</description>

<p>This raises the question in my mind about whether it may be worthwhile to proxy any link on a library site, even if it&rsquo;s a non-restricted site. May be at least worthwhile for links to digital libraries and open databases (oai, etc).</p>
<p>One of the things with dchud&rsquo;s implementation that didn&rsquo;t work as well is that it didn&rsquo;t use the text we set-up in the API and also didn&rsquo;t include the additional links. For some reason we have multiple resolvers listed and the first one isn&rsquo;t very useful (ILL) comparatively. We&rsquo;ve since changed the order though so that should take care of that problem. As for the buttons, they do look nice but having the same text that FirstSearch and other sites use from the API may be less confusing. Just a few minor points.</p>
<p>If you developing some sort of repository or other database this may be something worth looking into. OPAC products would also be interesting. I&rsquo;ll have to bother Casey about including it in WPOpac.</p>

      <description>An article on search methods and toolsthat may be of interest to reference and other librarians.
Developing good search skills requires study, experimentation, exploration, and a routine for keeping up with the latest developments in search engine technology. That goes for information technologists, instructional technologists, and librarians. As information professionals expand their repertoire of tools and techniques to improve their own search skills, they can in turn educate their end-user communities to do better than just good enough.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few posts about it but LiB goes over the use of the MeeboMe widget in librariespretty well. One of the big benefits of such a widget is that you can include it at problem points. An OPAC search bring up zero results? Display the widget in the sidebar. It&amp;rsquo;s also anonymous and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require anyone to add you to their buddy list, providing an easy virtual reference for those who don&amp;rsquo;t use IM.</description>

<p>Another service I like, which would be outreach, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Qunu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It allows &ldquo;experts&rdquo; to sign up and tag themselves with their expertise. When someone has a problem relating to that tag they can see what experts are available and chat with them via the website. The site is based on Jabber, which is nice to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a similar idea for libraries or support desks. It would be nice to have a system that allows patrons to chat with support via the website similar to above. Behind the scenes would be a server that multiple support staff would be logged into. The server then routes the incoming question to an available staff, spreading the load among users. This gives a single entry point for users but allows multiple staff to participate. There are multiple libraries for jabber for web-based languages and I think some complete web clients. The big part would be designing the routing system. It also may already exist. Another possible interface would be to list the available reference or support with some of the specialties (and their status) and allow the user to choose. Pretty much Qunu but install locally if possible. It would likely be more overhead then some libraries want to do. For those I&rsquo;d recommend taking a look at the sites above.</p>

I&rsquo;ve followed the syndication arguments since near the beginning though I&rsquo;ve stayed out of it myself. Recently I&rsquo;ve been working on parsing incoming feeds and have found out how terrible many are. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Library Web Chic has also noticed some of these problems.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> In order to try to do my part I&rsquo;ve made some changes. I apologize for any aggregators marking things as new.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the items that have come up in many discussions is for you to choose a format and support it. Offering the same content in multiple formats can just lead to confusion. It also leads to more work trying to keep things validated and working. You can still have more that one feed (comments, posts, etc) but should stick with a format. From <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft&rsquo;s best practices<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nick Bradbury (of TopStyle and FeedDemon) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also recommends this route for an additional reason<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All my feed URLs (outside of comments) should point to the same feed now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Due to me changing domains and unstable hosting, I had moved my feed to feedburner. This gave me nice things like stats for subscriptions and items. Recently they changed their service, making the item URLs very ugly. This likely doesn&rsquo;t matter for many but my feed is announced in IRC. This, coupled with validation errors, has let me to stop redirecting to the feed. Right now I&rsquo;m leaving the Feedburner feed up and working. However, I may remove it in the future. If you subscribe to that feed please change it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the new final one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I will do my best never to move it again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>During my work with syndication feeds I&rsquo;ve found various problems that would cause anguish. The first thing I would do is to look and see whether it was valid to do something, so I would know whether I could complain to the creator or not, or if it was a bug in my code. I found the many RSS formats were fairly ambiguous. Usually it was much less so with the Atom spec. Due to this I have decided that the format I will support is Atom 1.0. I have modified Wordpress&rsquo;s feed to provide valid Atom, which supposed is slated for a future Wordpress release. My feed provides both excerpts and full text. If you use an aggregator such as Bloglines you should be able to display either. I&rsquo;m uncertain about other aggregator support but Atom support seems to be getting better and better.</p>
<p>This, of course, was my choice based on my experience. You may choose to support something else. If you notice anything weird with my feed, please let me know in the comments. The comment feed is still RSS 2.0 and I&rsquo;ll likely change that in the future as well.</p>
<p>Remember to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->validate your feed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Now I just need to do something about the website itself.</p>

      <description>Bloglines has released a namespace for specifying access control for your feed, presuming you provide RSS 2.0 or ATOM.
This also presumes the software you use allows customization of feeds. Not sure if this will catch on with other aggregators.
Libraries should still be careful about what content goes into feeds, but this offers a mechanism to help prevent accidental sharing of even non-identifiable data.</description>

Just an option for some libraries.</p>

      <description>Lifehack.org has a post on 8 Expenses to Cut and How. One of the suggestions is to use a local library.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done similar and now really only read books that friends loan me or that are at the library. Most of my reading is technical though and I find the books are obsolete before I even finish them. Some of the other suggestions that I follow:
While Netflix is a monthly charge, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I end up saving since I no longer rent/buy movies or go to the theatre.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While Netflix is a monthly charge, I&rsquo;ve found that I end up saving since I no longer rent/buy movies or go to the theatre. It also prevents me from going out all the time and spending money. I dropped my WoW account as well. I also don&rsquo;t have TV and just rent shows when they come out on DVD.</p>
<p>As for the drinking, I went a step further and brew my own beer, though I&rsquo;ve been lazy lately. It is quite the savings, especially if you drink decent beers.</p>
<p>Coffee, I also roast at home. You can get premium coffees for less then it costs pre-roasted and the green coffee beans stay fresh for quite some time. You just roast what you need and you always have the freshest pot. I can buy a pound for the price of a grande at the local coffee place.</p>

      <title>Data API&#39;s in Libraries</title>

      <description>I strongly believe that if you are spending the time and money to pour data into a system then you should have the ability to harness that data in a way you see fit. If all you can do is export it back out then it&amp;rsquo;s really not complete. What I&amp;rsquo;m referring to is of course API&amp;rsquo;s. The ability to search or access your data in a way that allows you to use it to it&amp;rsquo;s full potential.</description>

The ability to search or access your data in a way that allows you to use it to it&rsquo;s full potential. Innovative provides an XML server for the ILS that begins to fulfill this though it is lacking in some areas. I&rsquo;m hopeful they will will it in future releases. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is also moving in this direction though I still don&rsquo;t think I understand their model (which appears to be centralized). I have a feeling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OCLC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will also start offering more API&rsquo;s for those who pay to upload data to them. It would make the worldcat program much more enticing.</p>
<p>I recently gave a talk at our local Innovative User Group meeting regarding API&rsquo;s. I limited this one to just showing examples of what people are doing with them. My hope being to at least spark interest. My examples included z39.50, xml server, export and EZproxy. It&rsquo;s fairly Innovative-centric. I prepared an in-depth handout just in case things went wrong.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->MIUG 2006 Handout<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (69K pdf)</p>
<p>The only example I showed that is not in the handout is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Georgia Tech&rsquo;s Web Localizer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is built on the EZProxy web service among other things.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the developers for giving me information about their projects and any statistics they could find.</p>

      <description>My homestead seriously lacks some art. I found some nice ones over at Fleet Street Scandalthat also seem decently priced (ones I checked were $20 and ok sized). Haven&amp;rsquo;t ordered yet but plan on it. This post is mostly as a reminder for me.
Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll try my hand at some bob ross or something. Need more hobbies that allow drinking and smoking at the same time.</description>

      <description>Dave Pattern has created The Library 2.0 Idea Generator. There&amp;rsquo;s a similar function in #code4libwhere panizzi will generate ideas based on jargon. The command is @library2. A little more on the tongue-in-cheek side than Pattern&amp;rsquo;s. Here are some examples:

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written I think the ability to export or access data you put into something is important. When I&amp;rsquo;m looking at sites I try to make sure they have some sort of API or other service that allows you to get information out. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t written any reviews at Amazon, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know their API gives access to my reviews and I can delete reviews if necessary.</description>

While I haven&rsquo;t written any reviews at Amazon, it&rsquo;s nice to know their API gives access to my reviews and I can delete reviews if necessary. Most of Google&rsquo;s offerings also appear to let you export or download your data.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terry Reese posted about Tim O&rsquo;reilly&rsquo;s keynote on this very subject<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Some of the topics that come up are the licensing of said APIs and data and who owns the data that you put in. An interesting project that he links to is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Move My Data<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I came across two other posts about this idea, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one at ongoing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a followup at kontrawize<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Both are worth reading. There has also been some related posts in regards to proprietary data formats outside of web services.</p>
<p>These are important issues that libraries must take into account when building systems or buying vendor products. Innovative is planning some of this functionality and services like OpenWorldCat already have it. Some things to ask:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In regards to the last one I think it would be interesting to allow patrons to put in their Amazon information and then using their API (along with xISBN) import their reviews into the system when possible. You could potentially have it check for new reviews at a schedule, allowing them to input the information at Amazon and not have the hassle of duplicating it. I haven&rsquo;t messed around with the review portion of the Amazon API so I&rsquo;m not sure how feasible this actually is though.</p>

      <description>One of the things I like about conferences these days is that most post the presentations online so you can get something out of it even if you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to go. Add sites like ITConversationsthat records audio for some of the big ones. Many of the smaller ones are now offering audio and sometimes even video.
A shining example is Webstockwhich was in New Zealand. They have posted the slides as well as audio and video in multiple formats.</description>

When I first found the link to the site <!-- raw HTML omitted -->via Adactio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I presumed it would be some Windows Media streams I would have to dump, but I was amazed that they offer raw MPEG-1 as well as MPEG-4 in addition to the stream. But I have to agree with Adactio that podcasts for each format would have been nice. He has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->created an unofficial one for the audio files<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->added to Odeo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you happen to use it or want to easily post the content to your site.</p>
<p>Another interesting idea is that of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->presenters transcribing the audio of their talks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. May be more work than most are willing to put in though.</p>
<p>I have to end this with giving Jaf a hard time about the code4lib audio. Also are any podcasters going to code4lib2007? Anyone with an ok DV cam that can use an external mic? I&rsquo;d be more than willing to put the time in to transcode files if
someone has the equipment.</p>

      <description>Alas, getting funding for myself would likely be difficult, but I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how many tech libs are going to other conferences that are not really library related. Are there ones that standout?
Jafand reesetwere recently enjoying OSCON(and blogging some of it) making most of the rest of code4lib jealous.
Casey will be going to WordCampa Wordpress oriented unconference and I expect he will be blogging it.
BlogHeris going on right now but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if any library bloggers went.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an overview at engtech. Definitely not a replacement for sourceforge but a nice compliment, especially for smaller projects. The most useful feature will likely be the 100MB subversion per project (more at request). This might increase the number of small, but useful projects that are out there available for download. Take a look. Those libraries creating hacks for their systems might find it useful. I still like the idea of a centralized library subversion server though.</description>

      <description>There was a recent post on ALA Techsource that mentions OSS in libraries, among other things, that&amp;rsquo;s worth reading. Be sure to also read the comments. The use of open-source products is a large shift and may not work in every situation. It also does not rule out vendors, just certain business models. Definitely read Joshua Ferraro&amp;rsquo;s commentas he is one of those vendors.

The library offers a windows media stream of the talkonline. I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing with some transcoding with mplayer and ffmpeg so I went ahead and dumped the stream and transcoded to mpeg-4 in an ipod video friendly format.</description>

      <description>A hodgepodge of parts. Ignore the nasty looking speakers and monitor riser things. Hopefully can get some better looking stuff eventually.
It came with only windows but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself. Since the Pentium D is dual-core I was able to get it to show up in linux as dual processors. It&amp;rsquo;s capable of 64-bit but I decided to stick with 32-bit since it&amp;rsquo;s mature and I&amp;rsquo;m using things like Reiser4 which made it difficult to find good install disks that weren&amp;rsquo;t DVD.</description>

      <title>The Long Tail and Libraries</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a bit about the long tail before but figure I probably should again after a recent post on the ALA TechSource. In terms of libraries the long tail is probably easiest to understand as the library has a few books that get the most circulation while the majority of the holdings get little circulation. For most book publishers the high selling would be the new books, new to paperback, etc while older books barely sold and of course, out of print not at all.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve posted a bit about the long tail before but figure I probably should again after a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent post on the ALA TechSource<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In terms of libraries the long tail is probably easiest to understand as the library has a few books that get the most circulation while the majority of the holdings get little circulation. For most book publishers the high selling would be the new books, new to paperback, etc while older books barely sold and of course, out of print not at all. To get a better understanding I recommend reading the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is one of those areas where I think it is worthwhile to think of libraries as businesses. It costs money to house books. In order to save costs many libraries become part of consortia to spread holdings out and many weed through their collection for items that can be removed to make room for new ones. The thing to note is when your removing low circ items your affecting the long tail and the question to ask is could this item be a more in demand item if people could find it. Many businesses go the route of just carrying the most popular items, but how can libraries take advantage of their already large collection. In other words, making that collection earn it&rsquo;s keep.</p>
<p>Again I recommend reading both of Lorcan&rsquo;s posts above as he puts things better than I can. There are a couple ideas that I think should be stressed though in the case of libraries. These are also important when thinking about &ldquo;next generation catalogs&rdquo;. I think the ALA post got it right when they stressed the ability to find things easily.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the main problems I have with library catalogs is that it is difficult to find things unless you know exactly what your looking for. There&rsquo;s many reasons for this that I won&rsquo;t get into, but right now many libraries just have an inventory system. One of the ways NetFlix and Amazon make their large holdings worth the cost is suggestions. The majority of the movies I&rsquo;ve rented from NetFlix have been suggestions and it&rsquo;s one of the things that keeps me coming back. I have not used the feature at Amazon to the same extent though it has come in handy quite a bit when researching products. The simple things like &ldquo;people who read this also like this&rdquo; are well worth the effort to add. Many libraries already have circ statistics but they aren&rsquo;t being put to full use.</p>
<p>For research libraries this would likely be a little more difficult but there is still plenty of room for improvement. Better metadata and linking between texts would help. Unfortunately much of this would require more digitization, which leads me to:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>O&rsquo;reilly has probably taken advantage of this the most (with Safari), though Google Book Search has the same premise. Amazon is also beginning to take advantage of it. Many books are hard to find because of limited metadata. There&rsquo;s been many times I&rsquo;ve missed books in the catalog because table of contents weren&rsquo;t included or the title was not descriptive. In many cases you really need some sort of full text or at least a term index for the work in order to make it findable and useful. This seems especially important in science related works but is probably important elsewhere. I think it will be really interesting to see how some of the Google Libraries put their digitized works to use.</p>
<p>The ideal of course is offering instant online access but when not possible this doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case. I think Amazon will be one to watch as they push sales through full-text while not actually providing the full text online in all cases. Regardless this is something worth watching and it will be interesting to see if the possibility of sharing indexes comes about.</p>

      <description>One of the major shortcomings in my mind of OpenWorldCat was that it was difficult to search it unless you knew all the special words you needed. It looks like they are finally coming out with the central homepagethat I think will hopefully help it&amp;rsquo;s use. Better search engine inclusion would still be nice. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to see a decent API for participating libraries to integrate some of the features in local catalogs.</description>

      <description>Amazon used to have a &amp;ldquo;digital locker&amp;rdquo; which was used to keep track of any digital purchases. It appears they have now expanding this offering to track and book/video/music purchases you&amp;rsquo;ve made. You can also add anything else you already own. Similar to LibraryThing. Amazon calls this new offering YourMediaLibrary.
It offers various views including both cover art based and list mode. Here is a screen of list mode where i&amp;rsquo;ve clicked on a specific book.</description>

<p>As you can see you can tag items and easily rate them. I presume the ratings become part of the normal Amazon rating service. If you click full details you get a more expanded view which also allows you to review items. For music it also shows the audio tracks and lets you preview them. For movies it has some basic IMDB integration which pulls quotes, etc. Example:</p>

<p>My first impression is that the service is a bit slow and more complicated than other media library offerings out there. That said you get Amazon community and Amazon API backing. It will be interesting what kind of API&rsquo;s become available for it and what kind of projects are done. Amazon has a rather large API developer community so it could lead to some interesting things. Something to keep an eye on.</p>

      <title>Fee Services in Libraries</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few posts lately, led by LibraryMan, about whether or not libraries should replicate parts of NetFlix. Here&amp;rsquo;s some posts worth giving a read:
LibraryMan&amp;rsquo;s post was in response to those who believe all services should be free as it&amp;rsquo;s a public institution. David Lee King picks it up and discusses why some additional services could be charged for while the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; services would remain free.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s been quite a few posts lately, led by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibraryMan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, about whether or not libraries should replicate parts of NetFlix. Here&rsquo;s some posts worth giving a read:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>LibraryMan&rsquo;s post was in response to those who believe all services should be free as it&rsquo;s a public institution. David Lee King picks it up and discusses why some additional services could be charged for while the &ldquo;core&rdquo; services would remain free. There&rsquo;s some debate in the comments which are worth reading.</p>
<p>Let me first start off and say that I use NetFlix and love the service. They&rsquo;re prices have gone up over the years but it&rsquo;s still at a point where I find it an attractive alternative to spending my entire life in World of Warcraft instead.</p>
<p>I personally would like to see all services as free. Having said that I can see where some libraries would need to charge for some expensive services they can&rsquo;t afford but there&rsquo;s a demand for. For example, there seem to be plenty of libraries that charge for ILL requests. Mailing heavy books isn&rsquo;t the cheapest and some may be only able to cover part of the cost. If they&rsquo;re able to keep it cheap then I would prefer a library offer the service versus not offering it at all because it can&rsquo;t be done for free. There are probably even more libraries that charge for photocopies. A fee service is a fee service, no matter how small.</p>
<p>Another example is home delivery. Delivering books to people would not be the cheapest service to offer. It would also not have as high a use as other, cheaper services might. But there are likely people in the community who would benefit from such a service and who would be willing to pay alittle to get it. In talking with Alan Gray of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Darien Library<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about this, he had an idea of using a box a month model. You get a box which you can have filled with whatever books you like. You pay a monthly fee and the box gets picked up and delivered. There was even the idea of piggy backing on local delivery services such as pizza and flowers to save a few dollars in personnel.</p>
<p>One of the ideas that commenters had a problem with was that of weighted holds. Paying to get to the top of the heap in that sense would likely not work out well. However, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AADL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is currently doing something related called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zoom Lends<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which from what I hear works well and is fairly popular. I&rsquo;m not sure if I completely understand how it works but I&rsquo;m sure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blyberg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will correct me if not.</p>
<p>The general premise is that some popular books get LOTS of holds. The library itself has some sort of buying strategy where if there are so many holds for an item then they likely go out and get another copy. In addition to that they also have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zoom Lends<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shelves at the various libraries. On these shelfs are copies of popular books as well. If you pay a buck a week you get the ability to checkout from these shelves. No holds and no requests, if it&rsquo;s there it&rsquo;s yours, if not then there&rsquo;s probably something else. I believe the lending period is also reduced for these. So the hold queue for the books stay the same but those in Zoom Lends collectively buy extra copies of books which they can checkout from. I almost see it as a library within a library.</p>
<p>In general I think libraries should strive to provide everything for free. Having said that, I believe there are some niche services that may be worthwhile to implement due to the people it could help, but which may require some sort of fee due to the low demand and cost to implement. If demand in the service grows then ways to fund it for free could likely be developed. If the service is never offered then there will likely never be enough demand to have it offered on a free basis.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s been quite a few discussions lately about what the future library catalog should look like and how it should function. As can be expected, google and amazon (among others) come up and there is argument over whether we should follow their lead in order to &ldquo;stay relevant&rdquo;. I personally think that trying to copy others will do nothing but produce another failure. Instead, it would probably be better to take on some of the other &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; qualities that many companies have. In order to get a feel I suggest giving a read to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->37signals' Getting Real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which I quote from below. It will give you an idea of some of the things you should keep in mind when working on a web presence or application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whether you like to admit it our not you will likely have to change in the future. The question then becomes can you change and how easily can you do so. For most it&rsquo;s likely a painful process. Training, blackbox tech, inflexible systems and organization buy-in are all contributers. For libraries to become more nimble and responsive to change then there will likely have to be quite a few changes to the work environment and the backend of the systems.</p>
<p>It is probably worth looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open-ILS&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> OpenSRF framework in this regards, and their general architecture as well. I have a feeling that it will make change a bit easier, but a good chunk is over my head. As for the environment there will likely have to be a change in attitude where change is welcomed and not feared. Reading some of the library blogs makes me think this is also taking shape.</p>
<p>The take-home is that, unfortunately, change is expensive as it currently stands for many libraries. This needs to change.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can have the most flexible system, lots of meetings and testing, but in the end you&rsquo;ll get some things wrong. If you&rsquo;re depending on the vendor, then they will get things wrong. Can you react and fix it? You thought you had the hottest idea but no one liked it. Can you tweak it into something better or drop it completely? Or are you stuck until the next release cycle or the next time the committee is reformed?</p>
<p>It also seems that many still have the mindset of spending months &ldquo;perfecting&rdquo; a site or application, releasing it to the public and then promptly leaving it stagnant until 3 years down the road when they form another committee and repeat the process from scratch. Releasing a completely new presence it likely worth it occassionaly, but things should never be left stagnant. There are always things to tweak, enhance and fix. One of the qualities of &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; applications you may want to replicate is that of iterations. Sometimes the changes will be small, other times large, but there&rsquo;s always change. You adapting to what people need when they need it.</p>
<p>Sure some of these things may be fads and some may not work out, but if your able to change cheaply then the advantage of staying useful and pertinant to people likely outweighs it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful to keep a Getting Real series going for a little bit as there are a few other topics in the ebook that are worth noting. Again I recommend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->purchasing a copy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>The above is from OK/Cancelwhich I recommend giving a read if you do any usability or interface work. They&amp;rsquo;re recent comics on testing have been fairly humorous. I think the theme of the above one is applicable to how many see the library going forward and what I disagree partially with.
In the discussions I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on NCG4Lib and elsewhere, there seems to be mostly conversations about what the &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; catalog would look like and sites such as LibraryThing, Amazon and Google are listed as examples or competitors that should be emulated.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the discussions I&rsquo;ve seen on NCG4Lib and elsewhere, there seems to be mostly conversations about what the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; catalog would look like and sites such as LibraryThing, Amazon and Google are listed as examples or competitors that should be emulated. Leaving the competition idea to the side, I think it&rsquo;s important to remember that many libraries likely have different missions and different audiences. Trying to make a catch-all interface will likely just make things worse. I&rsquo;ve read plenty of complaints that generic tools like google and amazon fail to provide what they believe their patrons need.</p>
<p>In reality there are libraries that likely focus on preservation, ones that focus on research in a specific subject area, ones that are general research and ones that serve the general public but have a unique community to serve. There will likely be overlap between the libraries, as they all have similar holdings, but each catalog will likely be different in some way.</p>
<p>This brings me to what I think is going to probably be the most important feature of the &ldquo;next generation catalog&rdquo;:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think flexibility will be key. Currently many interfaces that are used were designed for one audience: librarians. Unfortunately many of these interfaces are also rather rigid so customization is limited at best. In response I see many hooking their ILS into other interfaces such as metasearch through z39 or other methods. Others are going the drastic route of exporting all their holdings into a completely different system.</p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent post at Lorcan&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> outlined the research the University of Minnesota is doing with regards to facilitating Undergraduate research. They have some interesting ideas and some of their programs are likely useful. If the catalog itself was more flexible they could likely do even more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As quoted above creating environments and workflows for particular communities will likely become important in the future. Unfortunately, again, most current catalogs seem inflexible and so many integration attempts depend on elaborate hacks and are probably a stretch to be referred to as &ldquo;integration&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; catalog will likely not exist on it&rsquo;s own at all but be part of something else such as a workflow, research tool or community portal. What that looks and behaves like will likely depend on the audience and the mission. I think this will not just affect the search interface but also things like error messages, result display, tools available, etc.</p>
<p>In short I think it&rsquo;s important to keep a couple of questions in mind:</p>

      <description>Awhile back I attended Library Camp and was lucky enough to have some dicussions with Alan Gray of the Darien Library. It&amp;rsquo;s a small public library that&amp;rsquo;s doing it&amp;rsquo;s best to stay relevant to the community. Some of the programs he discussed were quite inspiring.
One of his concerns was the technology side of things and that there was no way for his library to hire full-time programmers to accomplish some of the things other libraries, such as AADLare doing.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Awhile back I attended Library Camp and was lucky enough to have some dicussions with Alan Gray of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Darien Library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a small public library that&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s best to stay relevant to the community. Some of the programs he discussed were quite inspiring.</p>
<p>One of his concerns was the technology side of things and that there was no way for his library to hire full-time programmers to accomplish some of the things other libraries, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AADL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are doing. I threw out a few ideas such as companies like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibLime<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but that I would have to think about it more. It was a very difficult problem which is worth some discussion. I&rsquo;m still not sure exactly what&rsquo;s best but figure I should throw out some of my current thinking to get things going.</p>
<p>The idea is to make software and other solutions created by libraries and reusable as possible so that other libraries can implement what&rsquo;s out there without reinventing the wheel or expending as much resources as the original. Let&rsquo;s face it, there are libraries that won&rsquo;t be able to do this sort of thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first problem is the reliance on hacks. Many solutions are so dependent on library specific hacks that using them anywhere else would be nearly impossible. A possible solution to this would be the idea of abstracting the vendor layers as much as possible and use a standard input instead.</p>
<p>For example, I threw together a quick OpenSearch module based on the III XML Server. In hindsight it would have probably been better to build it on a standard layer and then make a library to convert from this standard to III XML and back. Some of the benefits:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So what should this standard be? I&rsquo;m not sure yet. From talking to various people it seems like SRU/W is a good candidate for search-based applications. The data format? MARCxml seems like a likely candidate. There&rsquo;s still questions regarding holdings formats.</p>
<p>I got this idea from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Walker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did a similar project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for likely different reasons. He needed a way to hook the INNOPAC into a metasearch product and that product happened to support SRU. I think it&rsquo;s fairly easy to build more and more on top of that.</p>
<p>Cons: An additional layer, performance, etc. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty but at this point I think the benefits likely outweigh it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important that things created by libraries should be usable by other libraries. A major potential barrier to this would be licenses that prevent people from freely using it. I&rsquo;m not sure what, if any, licenses would be the best for this. Some prefer GPL, others like BSD, Apache, etc. Probably a point worth discussing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll again use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibLime<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as an example as I got the chance to talk to kados about it. LibLime is a company that supports open-source software in libraries such as Koha. They also do custom development of software that works on top of other vendor products. One of their requirements though is that the software they create on contract will be open-sourced so that other libraries (and liblime) can reuse what was created. I think this is a great idea. When a library that can afford to contract for an item has it created, all libraries benefit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think community will play a large roll as it created a cheap form of help and support. Right now I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#code4lib<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fills that role well. How well it would scale I&rsquo;m uncertain, but it would be something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Documentation is also a roll the community can serve which some of use are doing for the III XML server, an expensive and poorly documented product.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is the first version of this idea and I will likely change my mind next week about it but please feel free to post comments or trackbacks with ideas or critiques.</p>

      <description>As someone with a science background I try to keep up with OA type concepts as I think it will change how things are done and probably for the better. PLoS Oneis an upcoming offering that is hoping to change how scientific knowledge/research is shared. There are likely plenty of research that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it to publishing in a large journal but may still be worth sharing with a wider audience.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>CS: They will be asked to answer a simpler question than has traditionally been asked. Essentially, that question will be: &ldquo;Has the science in this paper been done well enough to warrant it being entered into the scientific literature as a whole?&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>Related to my Data Fidelity postis the multitude of &amp;ldquo;web 2.0&amp;rdquo; sites out there. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to pay attention to is the ability to get the data I put in back out. It&amp;rsquo;s an important thing to keep in mind and I should really go back through the sites I use and make sure I can actually get everything out, 100%.
This idea came up in an interesting thread at Flickr.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Related to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data Fidelity post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the multitude of &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; sites out there. Something I&rsquo;ve tried to pay attention to is the ability to get the data I put in back out. It&rsquo;s an important thing to keep in mind and I should really go back through the sites I use and make sure I can actually get everything out, 100%.</p>
<p>This idea came up in an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting thread at Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It seems Flickr normally would not want to grant a license to Google so people can import into Picasa. In general, not to a direct competitor. It appears they had a change of heart and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->came up with another idea<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The reasoning here is partly just that &ldquo;fair&rsquo;s fair' and more subtly, like a GPL license, it enforces user freedom down the chain. I think we&rsquo;ll take this approach (still discussing it internally). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I recommend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reading the post over at O&rsquo;Reilly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (where i found it) and the comments there.</p>
<p>If libraries move to a more API-centric model or start providing data feeds for various sites to use it will be important to keep this in mind. For example if we provide patron webservices which allow users of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->libraryThing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to easily keep track of what they read it would be important to make sure libraryThing allow patrons to export their collection data to the library or other services. This is a poor example but hopefully it gets the gist across. I think a similar thing could be said for RefWorks and other sites as well.</p>

      <description>Think about the various software you use, including the ILS. Can you get your data out? Probably. But can you get it out without using that specific software or a vendor supplied solution? Could you write a script that converts the raw data on the system to another format? The answer is probably too often no.
I&amp;rsquo;ve personally lost email over the years due to outlook deciding it didn&amp;rsquo;t like the old files.</description>

But can you get it out without using that specific software or a vendor supplied solution? Could you write a script that converts the raw data on the system to another format? The answer is probably too often no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve personally lost email over the years due to outlook deciding it didn&rsquo;t like the old files. 3rd party scripts did little better. I&rsquo;ve also lost various other data due to corruption or migration. My real concerns for this problem only came when I started working with library related things such as the ILS, Citrix, etc. The closed nature of everything and the multitude of walled silos of information was rather depressing. Wasn&rsquo;t this supposed to be a place of information exchange and preservation? Apparently only in carbon form.</p>
<p>Mark Pilgrim, of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dive into Mark<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is finally back blogging and I recommend reading the following posts and try to remember these points:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another important idea in all this is that open-source doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean open-format. It&rsquo;s less of a hurdle but documentation is a requirement. I&rsquo;ve found this especially true with the III xml server. You can get quite a bit of data out, presuming you know how. I&rsquo;ve found it similarly frustrating tracking down quality documentation for some of the various library formats. Some of the specs are less than straightforward.</p>
<p>And then there are the cases where the implementations aren&rsquo;t to spec or the vagueness of the spec causes problems across data stores. If I gave you MARC data from many institutions you&rsquo;d probably spend some time taking care of differences among them. There&rsquo;s also the case of vendors extending things without documentation or going their own way. I recommend giving Sam Ruby&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accidently Closed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> post a read.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I do see some progress in libraries. More are demanding access to digital material for archiving and preservation in case the publisher goes poof. But don&rsquo;t forget where YOUR storing the data. If the data format, software, hardware or OS vendor goes poof, can you recover everything without loss?</p>

      <description>I won&amp;rsquo;t both linking to all the applicable posts. Blyberg has a nice round-upand I recommend reading all of the linked items to get an idea of the dialogue going on.
There has been an increase in discussion about where OPAC&amp;rsquo;s are heading or should head. My personal opinion is that there will be commonalities but that each library and community is a bit different so there is no one grand ideal.</description>

<p>There has been an increase in discussion about where OPAC&rsquo;s are heading or should head. My personal opinion is that there will be commonalities but that each library and community is a bit different so there is no one grand ideal. With that in mind the ability to highly customize will be increasingly important. Whether it&rsquo;s more modular design or just API/data feeds is up for argument.</p>
<p>One thing that I don&rsquo;t think is worth time arguing about is who&rsquo;s fault it is. No vendor really pushed much innovation and no library really demanded it until now. Lets all get working.</p>

      <description>Not sure how long ago it came about but Amazon has a Grocery areain beta with non-perishable items. It appears that a good chunk are organic or specialty items (almost 300 gluten-free items). I&amp;rsquo;m uncertain of how competitive their prices are. They do seem to have some bundle deals.
One of the new features: Shopping List. It allows you to keep track of things you buy routinely so you can order them all with ease.</description>

<p>From a quick read it appears their major concern is the use of the icon for proprietary feed formats, those that can&rsquo;t be implemented by FOSS developers. I can see that concern coming about when they worked with MS/IE7 and is probably a valid concern. There are also guidelines about color, min-size, etc. It will be interesting to see what the final guidelines look like and what they require.</p>
<p>You can get HQ versions of the icon at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feedicons.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> though not all versions may meet the guidelines it appears.</p>

      <description>Awhile ago I was selling an item on ebay. Without thinking I uploaded the photos to Flickr for hosting, when I think photo+hosting I think Flickr. Once I had done it though it dawned on me that it was probably against the TOS. I checked the Community Guidelinesand sure enough, selling things via your stream results in termination. Obviously I removed them immediately. The guidelines are a little vague though. I&amp;rsquo;m uncertain if you can take pictures of things you create/sell offline or elsewhere but don&amp;rsquo;t actually sell via the stream (paypal links, etc).</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Awhile ago I was selling an item on ebay. Without thinking I uploaded the photos to Flickr for hosting, when I think photo+hosting I think Flickr. Once I had done it though it dawned on me that it was probably against the TOS.

The guidelines are a little vague though. I&rsquo;m uncertain if you can take pictures of things you create/sell offline or elsewhere but don&rsquo;t actually sell via the stream (paypal links, etc). Regardless I didn&rsquo;t take the chance.</p>
<p>Another thing that some people might miss is that Flickr counts itself as photos only. If you upload mostly screenshots or non-photo items then your likely to have your stream removed from the search. They won&rsquo;t terminate though at least. There&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent article at Wired about a crackdown on such accounts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think a good majority of their users are guilty of posting such things, especially with the popularity of things like World of Warcraft and Second Life. If you one of those Second Life librarian and go screenshot happy then don&rsquo;t be surprised if you account stops showing on search.</p>
<p>Another important (and vague) guideline is the website buttons. Flickr obviously doesn&rsquo;t want you hosting all of your graphic files for you site on their servers. I&rsquo;ve seen some library blogs post graphics they made (L2 complient, L2 library, etc) just for show. However if someone starts linking to the icon on their website it may result in those accounts being removed. It&rsquo;s something worth noting and being careful about.</p>
<p>According to the article they are working on better and updated guidelines. I&rsquo;m still a fan of flickr but hopefully they see that their site has taken on it&rsquo;s own life and is no longer just a &ldquo;photo sharing&rdquo; but a &ldquo;digital image sharing&rdquo; one. And many times a screenshot is just a photo of a digital world.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve come across quite a few pdf/document managers for OSX. iPapersis a bit different as it is centered around PubMed PDF documents. You can search from within the app or easily import documents if they are named using the PMID. iPapers retrieves the metadata from PubMed for you. It allows you to filter papers by author, title, date, etc. A rather narrow use application but an idea that might be worth expanding.</description>

<p>I still think citation management will likely move to the web but organizers like this may have it&rsquo;s place, especially if you can search across large indexes in a single, simple interface. I&rsquo;ve seen posts on various blogs/irc/email talking about the idea of creating an open-source refworks clone that can be tightly integrated with metasearch offerings, etc. Will be interesting to see if anything comes of it.</p>
<p>I think the importance of web services, coins/openurl, uri&rsquo;s etc will come to the forefront when these sort of applications begin to be built. It will likely be of some complexity in order to get it to be simple for the users. I&rsquo;ll leave the debate over whether it should be simple to ngc4lib.</p>

The workbook section was by Elsevier and Learning Objects. They have taken the workbook model of what usually came with textbooks and integrated it with various LMS&amp;rsquo;s.
This session was about what they were working on but was also a bit about how to integrate systems within ANGEL that are hosted separately (full applications).</description>

      <description>This presentation was by Allan Gyorke of Penn State. It was another one about using Resource Libraries which I think may be underused here.
I&amp;rsquo;d been fairly confused about the master course option but got a good handle after this and some other sessions. One hack to force people to link to an item is to create a repository and then link to the items in a master course. If someone copies the master course it is still a link.</description>

<p>Another common problem I&rsquo;ve seen is quizzes in libraries. If you link then all the information is submitted to the library. The solution again is to use a master course. You can create the question banks in the resource library and then pull them into the master course (new quiz shell). When the master course is copied you get the links to the content items and real quizzes but the quizzes still pull the questions from the library so you can update the questions there and have all affected courses updated. A useful solution.</p>

      <description>This presentation was about having a helpdesk on absolutely no budget (on the side). In this case it was for the Southwest Virginia Education and Training Network which includes quite a few different schools and grade levels. They wanted a timely helpdesk but due to the finances could not do 24/7. There are really only two main people doing support. At first it was by a department email. They then created a problem tracker within ANGEL as a nugget on their My Page.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a similar design for our helpdesk though not integrated in ANGEL. I&rsquo;d prefer to pull in information into the staff interface using some sort of API along with our other SIS systems. Would be good to have the submission form within ANGEL insert more useful information automatically for troubleshooting.</p>

      <description>This presentation was by Victoria Neeshan of Independence University which is completely online, rolling enrollment. They&amp;rsquo;ve used the ANGEL actions to automate many processes and to allow large courses to be taught by a single professor. Students are given constant feedback during the course and the professors are emailed updates when needed. One example given was the final exam which is proctored.
Prior to using ANGEL and actions this process was much more convoluted and it often took a week before students heard back.</description>

<p>Prior to using ANGEL and actions this process was much more convoluted and it often took a week before students heard back. Now it is hours or a day. I really don&rsquo;t think we use actions to the full benefit and will definitely have to play more with them.</p>

      <description>This presentation was also presented by the University of Waterloo. The presentation was mostly about the team features. The university of waterloo has apparently been giving quite a bit of feedback regarding the team features and what they have become. The example course in this case was a 800 student course with 4 sections.
It&amp;rsquo;s good to see they added all the settings as previously some were missing from the override screen.</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see they added all the settings as previously some were missing from the override screen. Seems they removed the individual user option though. The team journal is in 6.x and will likely help quite a bit with cleaning up some courses. We&rsquo;ve had some problems with team naming schemes so the idea of 200+ teams sounds a bit frightening though.</p>

They have a rather large resource library available which faculty are allowed to contribute to (peer-reviewed). It contains learning activities along with global documents such as student policies. They did a small usability study to see how it could improve. Some hilights:
The findings match up with some of my experience.</description>

      <description>This presentation was by Peter Friesen of Plattsburgh State University of New York and probably had the most take-home ideas of any. The presentation went over problems and workflows that were just too complex to expect faculty to complete.
Originally a SLN(apparently lotus notes based??) user they moved to ANGEL and experienced some problems getting the data moved over. His solution was to transform content to an ANGEL Archive that could then be imported by the professor.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This presentation was by Peter Friesen of Plattsburgh State University of New York and probably had the most take-home ideas of any. The presentation went over problems and workflows that were just too complex to expect faculty to complete.</p>
<p>Originally a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SLN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (apparently lotus notes based??) user they moved to ANGEL and experienced some problems getting the data moved over. His solution was to transform content to an ANGEL Archive that could then be imported by the professor. He used XSLT among other things.</p>
<p>A second problem was Word HTML that many tried to copy and paste into the LMS which usually caused formatting problems. His solution was to use regex to strip some of the problematic tags and again transform it into something professors could easily upload.</p>
<p>A third problem was multimedia. While most can do recording, to give a good experience for an online course they prefer to have it encoded in multiple bitrates and uploaded to a streaming server. They also like to include synced transcripts,SMIL,etc. His solution was to create a program using the Window Media SDK that would convert the media file for the professor. The application then takes their credentials and uploads the file to the streaming server, which automatically creates a playlist file. The application then takes this information and creates a HTML page with the embedded information and any metadata information the instructor included and posts it to ANGEL as a normal ANGEL Lessons Object (the professor can choose where to publish it to). We also have a streaming server so I found this very interesting as a help with workflow. He accomplished this by creating an ASP page that acts as an API for him, posting information to the database and returning some of the lists as XML.</p>
<p>Seeing some of the workflows that are possible with some small hacking (there is an actual API that might be usable instead) gives me hope that quite a few problem/advanced areas we have could become alot simpler in the future. Desktop integration would be one. I had also played around with the ANGEL Archive format and had played with some XSLT for it but I can see now that it may be even more useful that I thought and worth messing around with.</p>

      <description>I attended the ANGELUsers Conference this year and found it well worth the time. It helps to see what other people are doing with a product and how they are taking advantage of certain features. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit that can be done with some of the tools we&amp;rsquo;re not taking advantage of.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know ANGEL is a Learning Management System. Most will be familiar with the 800lb gorilla Blackboard or the OSS option of Sakai.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I attended the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ANGEL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Users Conference this year and found it well worth the time. It helps to see what other people are doing with a product and how they are taking advantage of certain features. There&rsquo;s quite a bit that can be done with some of the tools we&rsquo;re not taking advantage of.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know ANGEL is a Learning Management System. Most will be familiar with the 800lb gorilla Blackboard or the OSS option of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sakai<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The software was initially started at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis but was eventually spun off as a company. Talking with the people involved I was fairly impressed with their enthusiasm for the product and it&rsquo;s future. There is a bit of a family attitude to it. While there&rsquo;s plenty of things I&rsquo;d like to see change, overall I&rsquo;m fairly happy with it. I also think now that some of it is just likely limited by our understanding of the product or policies in place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not being a morning person I wasn&rsquo;t completely conscious during this session but it did have some interesting points. The people involved were also very enthusiastic about their work. Kentucky apparently has some higher education problems where they are not getting as many students through college. The use of online courses may help turn this around. They are also using it for student co-op and partnerships with local businesses. An interesting note is when talking to businesses they work with they never mention &ldquo;distance education&rdquo; as it has too many negative connotations (complex and expensive). They use &ldquo;elearning&rdquo; instead. The two demands by businesses is flexibility and support for languages such as spanish. ANGEL is fairly flexible and now has language packs. Online courses also work great for businesses compared to other education/co-op environments. Schools can use the assessments to match up students with prospective employers. They are also useful for employers that give education assistance as a benefit. Employees no longer have to wait to use their benefit but instead can find open entry/open end (rolling enrollment) courses to get them back in the game. The feeling is that you need to get them back into education sooner than later or they never will.</p>
<p>In order to bring more money into the state they are also marketing their offerings as widely as possible in order to bring in the out-of-state tuition dollars. They recommend listing your online programs in as many &ldquo;online education directories&rdquo; as possible. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ClassesUSA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of the examples.</p>
<p>Overall the feeling is that elearning may help both businesses and students that have previously had problems in educational settings.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>ANGEL is growing quite a bit so there are fears by some that they could easily turn into another Blackboard or WebCT (almost all attendees had horror stories). Most of the presentation was an attempt to alleviate these fears by showing some of the things ANGEL is planning and why their different. Here are some of the standouts:</p>

      <description>Another application that can be built on top of the XML Server is an IM bot. There are various libraries available for bots and having a way to easily get and transform the data from your ILS makes things much easier. The one below is on AIM and was built by Rob Cassonof Miami University Libraries in Ohio. The code is available from his blog. Below are some screenshots to give you an idea.</description>

Shrew itself is a SRU server that lays on top of the III XML Server and allows you standardized access to the III OPAC.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Shrew itself is a SRU server that lays on top of the III XML Server and allows you standardized access to the III OPAC. For an idea here is a simple diagram:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You may think this is a needless layer. Why not just build the interface on top of the XML Server itself. Here are a few reasons:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are some links that should get you going:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a better example of the usefulness of this, let&rsquo;s take a look at a more elaborate example. One of David&rsquo;s uses of Shrew is to integrate the III holdings with a metasearch product. They have decided to look at MetaLib by Ex Libris which can consume SRU-based servers and has an XML-based product that allows custom interfaces to be built on top of it. This means the III server becomes another holding source like any other that can be included in results. Here is a brief diagram:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some articles up on David Walker&rsquo;s site regarding this project (codename Xerxes)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The interface is currently under development and isn&rsquo;t public but here are some screenshots to give you an idea of what&rsquo;s possible. As far as I know this is far from the final interface so don&rsquo;t get too attached ;-)</p>
<p>Here is the search screen for the Biology Topic area:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Here is the results screen for a search. You can see the book holdings mixed in with the other results:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As you can probably tell abstracting the III opac under a SRU layer can make things easier and open quite a few possibilities with integration. As SRU becomes more popular the possibilities will grow.</p>

      <description>Amazon has rolled out a new Look/Search inside interface. Was fairly easy to use with the little that I messed with it. Also offers annotation/printing if the book is part of Amazon Upgrade. I can forsee google adding annotation to their offerings as well, even for the public domain. Could integrate with notebook and other offerings.

      <description>A couple posts recently came out that describe the state of library tech, including the ILS, OPAC and MARC. The general theme is that these choices made sense at one point (long time ago) but there&amp;rsquo;s no reason it should stay that way now. Also by staying the same we&amp;rsquo;re ignoring all the ideas and enhancements that the world around us are taking advantage of. Does integration make sense? Does citation-only search make sense in a world of full text?</description>

      <description>Nature&amp;rsquo;s blog Nascent has a poston the availability of Atom feeds for their content. The feeds (example) also have a prism and the custom otmi namespace for additional content/metadata.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother noting it but I find the otmi namespace interesting. Nature, not being OA, I presume doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to give the full text of their articles in an easy to access open format. There are still requests for information for data mining projects, apparently.</description>

There are still requests for information for data mining projects, apparently. The format provides keywords and their number of occurrences as well as snippets that are out of order for some context. I still lean towards OA but I see this being a helpful addition for those building indexes and meta-search initiatives in the mean-time.</p>

      <description>I posted previously about google co-opand what it might allow. One of the things I wanted to do was get our e-resource listings augmented and put up. My hopes would be to get some of the quality journals and indexes assigned common keywords they might be associated with. Our programmer Josh apparently read my mind and got an initial version up. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to bring stuff up for all subjects we have specified but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.</description>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to Canada in some time and never much outside of toronto and some stuff at the border. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to remember to get a passport this time though.</description>

      <description>I posted here previouslyabout passing the bib number out of the iii opac and mentioned citation formatters as a possible use. Rob Casson has taken this idea and used it to pass information on to refworks. He&amp;rsquo;s passing the marc record instead of using the xml server but the concept is the same and it makes sense since he&amp;rsquo;s not doing it all in house. Take a look.
This is just one example of what benefits access to data can bring.</description>

His ideas and explanations can come in handy when trying to get a grip on some of the phenomenon in quantum physics. There was recent article in New Scientistthat applied some of his work to the history of the universe which was quite interesting.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in previous posts that I think exposing library records alone may not be the best path, though it may help in some ways. I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned that I like some of google&amp;rsquo;s services such as the music aggregation, calculator and the like. Apparently you can build your own services that google users can subscribe to. If their query matches some you have specified then your result shows up at the top like a service.</description>

Apparently you can build your own services that google users can subscribe to. If their query matches some you have specified then your result shows up at the top like a service. I didn&rsquo;t know this was available but it opens the door for a lot of experiments. Digital collections, reference services and holdings could be pushed to the top when the query of choice is chosen. One way to push presence. It&rsquo;d be interesting to see if OpenWorldCat or similar add a subscribe service so that searching for an author or something close to the title brings up their find in a library at the top. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get some time to play with this.</p>
<p>I also came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post describing google co-op<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a bit more. It mentioned things like clustered results, meta-vertical-search, etc. Some interesting changes.</p>
<p>Right now none of it appears to be working for me so maybe they are slowly rolling it out. I get a 500 server error on most subscriptions i try to do and none of the custom results.</p>

      <description>Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;m not becoming a google blog but I came across another new google offering called trends. It lets you see the search history for specific terms or compare mutliple terms. It also plots events from the news. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of an official mashup of google search, news and finance. It&amp;rsquo;s also an interesting use of the data logs they have.
I think alternate interfaces to a dataset is an interesting area to play in.</description>

<p>I think alternate interfaces to a dataset is an interesting area to play in. The more rich data you have the more interesting the various things you can do with that data becomes.

      <description>Via Dan CohenI found that google has started an official blog about the book search service. Dan has a concern though:
I agree that would be nice if google provided this. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they will in the future or not. I&amp;rsquo;m not as concerned, however, since at LibraryCamp one of the UofM people mentioned that they are getting the OCR back from google. This means the library could provide the text and/or even submit it to the Internet Archive.</description>

This means even if google doesn&rsquo;t provide it there is still a likely chance that it will be provided by someone. I&rsquo;m hopeful that the libraries can work with the Internet Archive to make this possible (the OCR will likely be far from perfect) and make this information available in a timely matter. I think it also brings libraries back into the picture though still probably not easy to find.</p>

      <description>While I like the ideas behind WPOpac, I have to disagree with Casey&amp;rsquo;s post about exposing the information to Google. I actually have no problem with exposing, as you can do what you want, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s very helpful as is and would hope if more libraries do it that Google takes action and moves the results to the bottom. The information on most OPAC&amp;rsquo;s pages are only useful to a few people and it would make more sense to have it only show up when they include the library name or something similar.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I like the ideas behind <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WPOpac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I have to disagree with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Casey&rsquo;s post about exposing the information to Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I actually have no problem with exposing, as you can do what you want, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very helpful as is and would hope if more libraries do it that Google takes action and moves the results to the bottom. The information on most OPAC&rsquo;s pages are only useful to a few people and it would make more sense to have it only show up when they include the library name or something similar. It looks ok know and seems like it might be a good idea to have it wide open and high results but that&rsquo;s only because very few are doing it. When I search for an author or book the last thing I want is 20 pages of results for different libraries that all tell me nothing. Casey does include a link to WorldCat but it presumes you know what &ldquo;worldcat libraries&rdquo; is.</p>
<p>Now I should say that I think library holdings in search engines are a great idea and the way to go in the future but I have some caveats:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think Google could pull something off that was useful. I like their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->displays when you search for a band<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or album. I&rsquo;d like to see something similar when you search for an author or title. Google could work with libraries, oclc and others to get the dataset they need to group information such as this. OpenWorldCat within Google. Libraries/Worldcat could then be featured without clogging up results. I think Google could also expand their openurl or something they use with Google Book Search to general results. Those with an account could then choose their library and have it linked to from applicable results.</p>
<p>If I sound like I&rsquo;m saying that library results aren&rsquo;t useful it&rsquo;s because I find many aren&rsquo;t. A link in Amazon that says my library has an item is pretty useful. 10,000 results for different libraries when I&rsquo;m trying to look up some information online isn&rsquo;t. I do have to point out an exception though: rare out-of-print books. For books that only a few libraries hold it makes sense to let people know a print copy is still available as it might be worth the time and frustration to get. Again something like worldcat is often used and could be a help in this area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some disagree, feel free to write up your own opinion. This is just one by a library user.</p>

      <description>I use SVN/Trac for quite a bit of my development including my web projects for work. Both the repository and trac is private as most of my projects are internal. For testing purposes I usually have a copy checked out to a public webserver of each project as it&amp;rsquo;s a really easy way to prototype. One thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about was that the .svn directories are viewable if you don&amp;rsquo;t take precautions.</description>

It mostly just has information like repository address and doesn&rsquo;t have things like the password but if your one that doesn&rsquo;t want any of that sort of information being public you can do some easy rules in Apache or elsewhere to deny access to these directories.

      <description>The hack in this case is the ability to modify and actually use the product though I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are plenty of ILS security problems out there as well. A recent post titled State of our ILSbrought this up again and referred to the III ILS which I&amp;rsquo;ve also had the unfortunate fun of being stuck with. It&amp;rsquo;s luckily not my job to actually work on it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the spare-time project of reverse engineering as much of it as I can.</description>

A recent post titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->State of our ILS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> brought this up again and referred to the III ILS which I&rsquo;ve also had the unfortunate fun of being stuck with. It&rsquo;s luckily not my job to actually work on it, but I&rsquo;ve taken on the spare-time project of reverse engineering as much of it as I can. I do this mostly because I can see various uses for the underlying information for the online courses. I also like to understand how things work so when I get a crazy idea I can tell how feasible it is.</p>
<p>Most of my ideas require the ability to easily get data out and possibly back in. As most people have probably found the ILS, regardless of vendor, usually lacks in this ability. Some vendors are changing but some don&rsquo;t seem to even be considering it. I&rsquo;ll save you from the rant about lock-in. Go read the post above, everything is said better than I could.</p>

      <title>EZProxy URL Webservice</title>
      <link>https://ryaneby.com/2006/05/ezproxy-url-webservice/</link>

      <description>A useful feature that was added to ezproxy is the addition to a xml based webservice which you can send a URL and it will return the ezproxy information if it&amp;rsquo;s in the exproxy database or an false statement if not. This allows you to build applications that can go through URLs and rewrite them if they are valid resources. Think WAG the Dog Localizer. We&amp;rsquo;re currently migrating to ezproxy so this may come in handy with assisting people with updating links and verifying things are set-up properly.</description>

There&rsquo;s not much documentation on this feature but hopefully the following will help you.

<p>Straight from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->changelog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen this would be posted to the http://exproxyserver:port/proxy_url page. You can also use GET by doing /proxy_url?xml= followed by the request xml. If you use POST you will want to name your field as &lsquo;xml&rsquo;.</p>

      <description>A semi-recentpost at IT Garagethat pointed to a related presentationand an article at Linux Journalkind of sums up what I see happening in some libraries and with the code4lib community.
In reality, to build an enterprise, you have to have a set of experts in your IT shop who can put it all together. Certainly, historically you need a lot of expertise to get anything done, because this stuff really isn&amp;rsquo;t easy to put together.</description>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In reality, to build an enterprise, you have to have a set of experts in your IT shop who can put it all together. Certainly, historically you need a lot of expertise to get anything done, because this stuff really isn&rsquo;t easy to put together. But if you&rsquo;ve been led by the vendors to believe that everything dovetails together nicely, like you see in the .Net ads, or in any major marketing campaign that promises nirvana, you&rsquo;ve got a problem.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Some libraries are starting to piece things together and are sharing it with the community at large. There are also open-source based solutions becoming available which will offer even more choices and for those with the expertise at hand, maybe a little easier to implement and change.</p>
<p>But the problem comes about that not everyone has the expertise available and rely solely on vendors for solutions. How bad this is is dependent on your DIY mindset. There are plenty of people that depend on their dealership to keep their car going and have no plans on ever doing things themselves. As said above, many of these things aren&rsquo;t simple. At librarycamp this topic came up again and again and the possible solutions to this problem aren&rsquo;t necessarily simple either. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this quite a bit lately and I&rsquo;ll hopefully be posting quite a bit on my thoughts soon. Until then I recommend reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blyberg&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve come to like is the &amp;ldquo;lab&amp;rdquo; type sites such as Google Labsand Yahoo Next. It lets them post ideas and projects that may not make it to fruition but at least lets them gauge interest and find problems.
In library-land I&amp;rsquo;ve come across LCLS Labsand UofVa Library Labthough I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are others. Right now the majority of the experiments are on individual library coder&amp;rsquo;s sites or blogs.</description>

Right now the majority of the experiments are on individual library coder&rsquo;s sites or blogs. I think many of these ideas (such as bookmarklets, firefox extensions, etc) are worthy enough to be included somewhere on a library&rsquo;s site even if there is not enough buy-in to make them &ldquo;official&rdquo;. There are various reasons I think this is a good idea:</p>

<p>One of the drawbacks is the possibility of getting calls for support on these items. How you present these offerings will be important. You will probably want to stress that these are offered without support but for feedback purposes. How many institutions would go for this I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

      <description>I planned on doing a more indepth post about this but since it&amp;rsquo;s been a draft for over a month I&amp;rsquo;m just going to do a quick one. Lorcan at OCLC has, as usual, a great post on searching, specifically the single search box. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an important idea that a simple search box isn&amp;rsquo;t much without good results. You can&amp;rsquo;t really take a system that relies on user&amp;rsquo;s search knowledge and quickly change it to a simple one.</description>

<p>In order to make the front-end simpler for users, usually the back-end needs to become more complex to compensate. Relevency ranking becomes much more important and features such as spell-check more useful. If your application is designed presuming someone knows the exact title it will likely not work very well when they aren&rsquo;t sure at all. Things are slowly moving in libraries from the inventory role to the discovery role and it will be interesting what ideas are put into place to help discovery. Faceted limits, item relationships and related terms are all things I&rsquo;ve seen and I&rsquo;m sure there will be great new ideas coming up.</p>

      <description>While I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to mess around with it, it appears Google has come out with a read/write API that is used for Calendar and most likely other services in the future. From what I&amp;rsquo;m reading it appears that it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of Atom Store with OpenSearch and APP. It&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see how interoperable this is with the individual protocols. It also adds authentication. There&amp;rsquo;s a post over at BitWorking that gives a better overview.</description>

      <description>(via Cool Huntingand Inhabitat)
An interesting reuse of materials to create an interesting building. From the looks of the photo&amp;rsquo;s of the interior it almost looks open-air/glass covered inside, between fuselages. An LED glass wall also adds an interesting touch. Would be interesting to see what kind of advertisements or other displays they could do.
More photos at the sites above. No direct link at LOT-EKbut it&amp;rsquo;s located under Buildings &amp;gt; Institutional &amp;gt; New Jalisco Library.</description>

      <description>Came across a simple blog-like service today called Sabifoo. You add an IM bot to your contact list (aim, yahoo, jabber, MSN) and anything you send it (outside of certain commands) will be put in a sort of blog that has RSS and Web interface. The great thing is you don&amp;rsquo;t have to register presuming you already have an IM account. A page will automatically be created based on your IM account.</description>

It also supposed setting up gateways which would be forms that pass the data on to other services. There will probably be a plugin for Wordpress and others before long. For those who just want to start a simple blog this might be a solution. If you just need a simple way to update an RSS feed it may also be useful.</p>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten quite a few calls about this so I&amp;rsquo;ll post here in case any one else notices the problem. We received multiple calls about Internet Explorer giving a dialog about allowing ActiveX and then promptly crashing once you hit OK. This happened with Quicktime content but it may occur with any content type.
After much research and deduction I narrowed it down to a windows update with ID of KB912812.</description>

<p>After much research and deduction I narrowed it down to a windows update with ID of KB912812. This security update includes a non-security update with ID of KB912945. If you didn&rsquo;t know Microsoft lost a patent lawsuit with Eolas that led them to change how IE handled embedded content. In the process apparently they changed more then just adding a pop-up. After some more deduction I found that if you only have the EMBED tag without an OBJECT tag wrapping it IE will crash and burn. Add the OBJECT wrapper and everything is OK. I hope this helped anyone who is seeing this problem as well. There are also workarounds to get rid of the pop-up that uses Javascript but I was just happy to keep IE running. Here are some resources:</p>

      <description>The output of Azaroth&amp;rsquo;s meeting with A9 is up on their blog. Sounds like it will be a meeting of the minds, halfway type of thing. Being extension&amp;rsquo;s it might make it possible to keep the great simplicity of OpenSearch while taking advantage of some of the more advanced queries that SRU allows. From the post:
Will be interesting to see where this leads. I was playing around with allowing CQL type queries in opensearch but this will make it much more standardized.</description>

      <description>This discussion was led by Dave Carter of UofM. The main discussion point was what can libraries do with all the scanned works coming back from projects like Google Book Search. Copyright aside there were some interesting ideas.
There were no concrete conclusions in this discussion, just ideas for the future.</description>

      <description>This discussion was initially centered around easy things that can be done to enhance the OPAC. Nothing as drastic as the AADL redesign but still provide better services to patrons. The discussion ended up going all over the place and I managed not to take notes but here is what little I remember.</description>

      <description>One of the best plugins for Wordpressis Akismet, the centralized spam filter. It picks up almost every spam comment on this blog and has had very few false positives. It also learns from comments that you mark as spam so it&amp;rsquo;s likely to just get better. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the sole reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep comments open and not 100% moderated. I don&amp;rsquo;t get much traffic so it&amp;rsquo;s not as huge a difference for me but it has blocked 600+ spams since I recently upgraded it and has helped with some recent spam floods I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten.</description>

      <description>For more information on Library Camp check out the Library2.0 wiki.
This discussion went over the various hacks and problems that allow patrons to reuse information from the library or make it easier to use the library&amp;rsquo;s offerings. Some notes:
The take away message was that libraries need to be where the patrons want them to be. This could be links in IMDB and Amazon or RSS feeds that can be used to set-up SMS alerts.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really tested it much in terms of actual use but I did find the interface interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around with various interface ideas using the III XML Server and this gives another one for ideas. You can check it out yourself. There&amp;rsquo;s probably plenty of things I would change though. I&amp;rsquo;d probably have to pre-fetch the records to get decent rollover response as well. Not sure though.</description>

      <description>I have to admit that I ignored S3when I first heard about it. Simple storage? I was certain there would be applications like backup utilities and companies using it to host data in cases where transfer was just too expensive with the local ISP or similar. Nothing I&amp;rsquo;d likely ever use, though.
However I should have known better, especially with how much I&amp;rsquo;ve used Opensearch. Opensearch simplified the reuse of results, expanded syndication and gave new ideas for interfaces.</description>

I was certain there would be applications like backup utilities and companies using it to host data in cases where transfer was just too expensive with the local ISP or similar.

<p>However I should have known better, especially with how much I&rsquo;ve used Opensearch. Opensearch simplified the reuse of results, expanded syndication and gave new ideas for interfaces. It&rsquo;s likely that S3 will do similar for online storage and repositories. There were a couple of things that changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>The first was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post on the AWS blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> regarding the addressability of objects in S3. The thing that really caught my eye was that you could retrieve the metadata for an object without requesting the object with a simple http request. This fits in with the idea of using it as an object repository.</p>
<p>The second is that there are already <!-- raw HTML omitted -->people building clones of the interface<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for local storage. This opens up the possibility of hosting your own storage while using the many tools that are already being built to use the interface. It also gives me the impression that this may become a defacto standard for online storage and repositories similar to how opensearch is becoming a defacto standard (probably more so with IE7).</p>
<p>I have to admit that I still don&rsquo;t fully have my head around all of the ideas. I see potential for things like LOCKSS, dig libs, etc.</p>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a interesting and insightful post over at dietrich.ganx4 about a career day talkto 4th graders that involved Firefox, the Internet, open-source, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s worth a read. A point that caught my eye was the confusion over what a browser was and how it was different from the internet. As support for online courses I often have to ask similar questions and I get similar responses. I&amp;rsquo;d have to say at least half of the people I ask don&amp;rsquo;t know what a browser is or tell me who their ISP is instead.</description>

I&rsquo;d have to say at least half of the people I ask don&rsquo;t know what a browser is or tell me who their ISP is instead. I usually have to name browsers until I hit the one they use (usually IE). I see various discussions online about the internet being a platform and the decreasing importance of the OS and I think that&rsquo;s not just talk. Many of my callers see the internet as an icon they double-click on. The search box is how they find stuff. Address bar? Never heard of it, and some never used it. I won&rsquo;t try to guess how they would respond to questions about open-source. Quite a few of my calls end with &ldquo;get firefox&rdquo; though.</p>

      <description>A little late but here&amp;rsquo;s some brief comments on the second day. Again this is available online so you can see everything yourself. A couple general observations is that blogger seems to be the host of choice. This is true with some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on our campus as it is free and easy to use. One thing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned (unless I missed it) in either of these presentations was privacy concerns.</description>

<p>A little late but here&rsquo;s some brief comments on the second day. Again this is available online so you can see everything yourself. A couple general observations is that blogger seems to be the host of choice. This is true with some of the things I&rsquo;ve seen on our campus as it is free and easy to use. One thing that wasn&rsquo;t mentioned (unless I missed it) in either of these presentations was privacy concerns. If you have students posting to a public blog in some way for a course you need to make sure your complying with your state or institutions privacy policies. You may have to give other, more private options to students then posting on the blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Blogs are another hot topic in highered and the integration with online courses has come up multiple times here. This presentation went over the very basics of blackboard vs. blogs. We don&rsquo;t use blackboard at MSU so I can&rsquo;t speak for it. Here there are a few options. You can load the blog within a frame or you could use some sort of RSS2JS service to pull in the headlines. Since the presentation was mostly stuff I knew I actually found the comments more insightful. They talked about faculty education and support in regards to the tools available for them and the importance of that. As distance ed support I&rsquo;ve come across this numerous times and have even helped faculty at other institutions that happened to call our number. It sometimes amazes me that some institutions don&rsquo;t have as robust support as something as technical as online courses require. The support might be there, though, and just be an awareness issue. I think the departments on our campus could do more with advertising services, including the library.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This presentation was in regards to using blogs as a place for collabortive discussion for students from different cultures to learn from each other. I&rsquo;ve seen similar blog posts around the edusphere about middle school and other young classrooms doing similar things for &ldquo;pen-pal&rdquo; type relationships. I actually think the ideas of using cross-culture materials to teach was as interesting as using a blog to accomplish it. There were some interesting ideas and it is worth taking a look.</p>

      <description>Both presentations are by MSU people and I&amp;rsquo;ve already listened to a talk by one of them about blogs. The first one is research which I presume is meant to eventually support the second one which is about a resource site for faculty.
This presentation is the prelim findings for a study on blogging in the classroom, specifically blog vs paper. It&amp;rsquo;s a very initial study but gives a few ideas for further research.</description>

<p>Both presentations are by MSU people and I&rsquo;ve already listened to a talk by one of them about blogs. The first one is research which I presume is meant to eventually support the second one which is about a resource site for faculty.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This presentation is the prelim findings for a study on blogging in the classroom, specifically blog vs paper. It&rsquo;s a very initial study but gives a few ideas for further research. It also brings up the points that are true for any new medium/technology, that students have to adjust to the new medium and this may cause adverse effects. I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing the performance of the same students after 3 or 4 courses with blogs. It would also be nice to see it across more content areas. Blogs in science and blogs in humanities may be two very different things. It&rsquo;s a reminder that students have been writing papers since the moment they were taught to write. There&rsquo;s also the formality issue where people like me are used to writing short, incoherent shit online.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This presentation is about the creation of a resource site for the use of blogs in the classroom as mentioned before. The first half has quite a bit of information from focus groups so there are things to take away regardless. It&rsquo;s more students' feelings which is nice. The other half is about the site and so it may be just as well to wait for the site to be up. First part was worth watching though.</p>

      <title>Passing Bib Numbers from the III OPAC</title>

      <description>For those III institutions not as adventurous as AADL, you may want to be able to pass the bib number for a record to your own scripts. In this way you can use the stock OPAC but still add functionality externally. I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example below and some other ideas at the end.
So let&amp;rsquo;s start with an example. Our library doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the stock recall functionality. They prefer to do it themselves and so have a webform that patrons can fill out.</description>

In this way you can use the stock OPAC but still add functionality externally. I&rsquo;ll give an example below and some other ideas at the end.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with an example. Our library doesn&rsquo;t use the stock recall functionality. They prefer to do it themselves and so have a webform that patrons can fill out. But lets say we want to include a button or link in the OPAC that only shows up on specific criteria. This would likely be difficult in the stock set-up but if you use your own script coupled with the xml server you can pretty much set any criteria you want. You could have all items checked out and at least one requestable, only for books already checked out for a certain period of time, not available online, etc.</p>
<p>There are a couple ways to accomplish this, though in both you are passing the bib number to an external script. One is to wrape an image in a link with the image having the src of the script. The script then returns a button image if it matches criteria or a 1x1 blank pixel image if it doesn&rsquo;t, to prevent people from seeing or clicking on it. The other alternative is to have script tags where the src is your external script that document.write outs a link if it passes criteria or nothing if not, via javascript.</p>
<p>So how do you pass the bib number to an external script? The token for your template is &lt;!&ndash;{fieldspec:Fb081}&ndash;&gt; which I have to thank <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for. There are a couple caveats with the token:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So an example link would be:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So what are some possible applications you could build by passing the bib number and using the xml server? Well here&rsquo;s a few ideas:</p>

There were two presentations today with the topic of podcasting and screencasting. With such a hot topic I was rather disappointed to see only two presentations.</description>

<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t kept track the HigherEdBlogCon started today. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on writing up any notes since it&rsquo;s an online conference where anyone can watch/participate, but since it matches my interests I should at least comment on the ideas. I need to post more often anyways.</p>
<p>There were two presentations today with the topic of podcasting and screencasting. With such a hot topic I was rather disappointed to see only two presentations. However on further study that appears to be the format of the &ldquo;conference&rdquo;, two presentations a day. If you want more commentary on podcasting in education I suppose you can just check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->edupodder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve also recently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written about it here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This presentation came off a bit as a &ldquo;screencasting is better than podcasting&rdquo; though it is mostly how to use screencasting in a course. I personally think each has it&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses depending on the application. There are times when doing video makes sense and then there are times when audio would likely be preferable. He does give some good recommendation like doing topic-centric segments which helps students find the information they want. The presentation also mentioned syndication which is an important aspect and is sometimes overlooked by those in education. Posting material online is not &ldquo;casting&rdquo; in itself. Having multiple modes of access though is helpful though. The presentation was a worthwhile watch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Legal issues were also touched on in the first presentation (remove copyrighted works from your lecture slides), but this presentation went much more in depth and was broken up into two parts. The first part was an introduction to podcasting and to copyright law. It then went into what types of copyrighted content you may find yourself attempting to use in podcasts and what you can and can&rsquo;t use. There was a nice mention of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->creative commons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The second part of this presentation was about what educational uses are allowed. I won&rsquo;t bother recapping all the points of either of these presentations. If you are podcasting then you should watch these presentations. Don&rsquo;t presume that you have the right to use something for your course.</p>

      <description>FYI, if you try to access any of my XML server demo&amp;rsquo;s you&amp;rsquo;ll probably get an error message. We had to turn our xml server off for the time being due to some problems. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that it&amp;rsquo;ll be back on in the near future.

      <title>III Featured Lists from the XMLopac</title>

      <description>Featured lists are another thing I&amp;rsquo;d like to use more of. The ability to pull the latest books and other data from the server would be nice. While I figured out how to pull the information, the XML server appears to ignore my limiting and returns the whole list no matter what. This can be problematic if you have a large featured list. The way to get a featured list from the xmlopac is just take the list number and add a zero in front.</description>

I figured out the list number by going to /ftlists in the opac, clicking on a list and then taking the numbers directly after the letters bib.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to make this a bit more useful with the item data but we&rsquo;ll see if I can figure out how to limit/paginate it first.</p>

      <description>Before I forget to post this, David Walker was nice enough to drop me info on how to get the item information when getting bib results from the XML server. You can do this by appending the option of links=i1-10 to the end of the url. You also need to make sure you do the noexclude for the III data as the item records are part of it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if i1-10 limits the number of items but that&amp;rsquo;s my guess.</description>

<p>It returns some interesting and potentially useful information such as number of checkouts, renews, etc for that item. You can see an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example of some parsed output here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you need more bibnums to try just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search magic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it will be listed in the perm link url.</p>
<p>I think David Walker is likely working on some interesting things with this. I have many ideas on how to use this information. This also takes us one step closer to replicating many of the opac features in our own software or metasearch applications.</p>

      <title>Podcasting and the LMS - Podcast2JS</title>

      <description>Podcasting still seems to be taking off, especially in the academic worlds. I can say that I listen to podcasts quite a bit. While I still occasionally listen to audio at someone&amp;rsquo;s site it&amp;rsquo;s just convenient to have ones I like downloaded to my computer. I am one of the supposed 80% that don&amp;rsquo;t use a mobile devicefor it. I do have an ipod but often prefer to listen to music when I&amp;rsquo;m wandering around.</description>

While I still occasionally listen to audio at someone&rsquo;s site it&rsquo;s just convenient to have ones I like downloaded to my computer. I am one of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->supposed 80% that don&rsquo;t use a mobile device<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for it. I do have an ipod but often prefer to listen to music when I&rsquo;m wandering around. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I find it any less useful though, as it brings all the benefits of RSS to other forms of media.</p>
<p>As a former education major (and now distance learning support) I have a real interest in it&rsquo;s use in courses, especially ones online. Having this media in the form of podcasts/vodcasts/etc allows easy use by those that want the content. Students can subscribe to lectures (video or audio), articles or information (itunes supports PDFs) or just view the information in the course.</p>
<p>There was a talk on campus I think last fall regarding podcasts in our LMS (learning management system&hellip;blackboard, etc). Right now it is very difficult to include this sort of functionality right into the course and about all you can do is provide the link to the podcast or upload the files to the course yourself. This is far from ideal. RSS is in the same boat with our LMS as there isn&rsquo;t much support yet. You can bypass this by using some of the RSS2JS services that are out there. Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t find a similar services for podcasts, so I built a prototype instead.</p>
<p>In simple terms all it does it take a URL for an argument and then output the information via document.writes into the browser. This lets you include the information into any normal html page with no need of having server side parsing on the server in question. I also passed the enclosure URL to a flash-based mp3 player. In the screen below I&rsquo;m using the Odeo flash player though there are many available out there and ideally you would have one customized for the institutions. I&rsquo;ve blanked out the URL as it&rsquo;s not really production worthy. I&rsquo;d be interested if someone created such a service though. Odeo currently offers HTML for individual shows but doesn&rsquo;t have anything for full feeds.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In the example above the feed only has one show but it allows you to specify how many and will have a seperate box for each. I also include a link to download the mp3 file in case someone wants to save a specific show. The point of this is to allow you to show the most recent shows right inside your course or site (opac, etc). I&rsquo;ve also provided the information and links to allow the student or user to subscribe to the podcast in their aggregator of choice. This allows them to consume the audio how they see fit. If there is an enclosure that isn&rsquo;t an mp3 then I link to it instead as shown in the screen below.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Something like this has many uses though I would really prefer something that is built in. I&rsquo;d be interested if anyone has something production-worthy already done. Mine is more of a proof-of-concept hackjob, though it mostly works.</p>

      <description>Continuing day 1 of the conference.Slides (ppt)This session was a list of many things you can do with your opac to make it a bit more useful. This includes pulling data from other API&amp;rsquo;s or supplementing it with your own programming. Most of the stuff has been discussed on various blogs. The one thing that was new was the virtual reference. When someone accesses the virtual reference chat from the opac it will pass a session number that the reference librarian can use to view the person&amp;rsquo;s current search session, making it easier to identify problems with their searching.</description>

<p>This session was a list of many things you can do with your opac to make it a bit more useful. This includes pulling data from other API&rsquo;s or supplementing it with your own programming. Most of the stuff has been discussed on various blogs. The one thing that was new was the virtual reference.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t have slides to look over but I vaguely remember it being about the advantages of moving data out of the ILS. I only remember that because of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ecorrado<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another one where I don&rsquo;t have slides for reminders. I believe he went over elearning content design, including SCORM, and the ability to have various representations of it. The representations would be inside desktop software, online courses, etc. There&rsquo;s a big push in education for reusable learning objects so this is something to keep an eye on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were multiple breakout sessions but I went to the one on federated search interfaces. The general consensus in the room was that the current breed of solutions are terrible, if you can call them solutions. Most appear to be using SFX or similar. There was discussion about how much information to include, how to link things together, the problem with data from vendors, etc. There was also some loose discussion about interfaces to holdings in general similar to the lipstick on a pig session. Topics like tags came up which I&rsquo;ll likely discuss on this site later. A takeaway point was that the vendors don&rsquo;t supply all the data that would make this work best. It would be ideal to have the indexes on our end and then link to the content on their site. Supposedly Los Alamos was able to get this data from vendors though others have not had such luck. It was a good breakout session.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The lightning talks were all good though there were so many my memory is failing. Some standouts were Eric Hellman talking about security problems with many library systems, Charles Lockwood talking about making it easier to link to resources for faculty and Ross Singer&rsquo;s talk on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->link resolver abstraction (router)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The bar of the evening was American Dream Pizza and Crowbar. The pizza was decent, the locals were friendly and the beer was great. I have to thank Eric Hellman for putting up with my OpenWorldCat complaints.</p>

This conference was full of information so I&amp;rsquo;m going to split up the posts. A schedule with links to presentations is available. If my memory is too vague feel free to comment and correct. I have to stress that this only gives you a small idea of the great information at this conference.</description>

If my memory is too vague feel free to comment and correct. I have to stress that this only gives you a small idea of the great information at this conference. The discussions at lunch and at the bar afterwards were just as informative and probably more so at time. I&rsquo;ll be posting more soon.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slides (html)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I was looking forward to this talk as I&rsquo;ve followed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open-ils blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and think they are doing some interesting work, especially with the architecture (jabber, etc). The PINES consortia is a rather large state system. They found that the current vendor solutions did not meet their needs (wasn&rsquo;t designed for it) and began development of their own. They hope to release it so other libraries/consortia can use it as well. The system was designed from the ground up without much of the &ldquo;library-centric&rdquo; backgrounds one might expect. Catalogers and others were asked for their ideal workflow rather than implement the current workarounds they used with other vendors.</p>
<p>Another interesting note is that they are storing marcxml in the database but when they want to display it or index it they transform it to MODS. They only go to the original marcxml record when they need something that is not contained within the MODS version.  I believe they also stated they are using the PostgreSQL relevance ranking along with a few modifications.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slides (html)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve followed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Art&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for sometime as well and he&rsquo;s got quite a few interesting projects, including using Google Desktop to search library holdings. I can&rsquo;t say I understand much about the Acquisition side of libraries but the presentation still made sense. His main point seemed to be that ordering systems are very complex things with complex workflows and most ILS implementations are hacks or incomplete. Full-fledged ERP systems (non-library) would likely be a better investment and provide better workflows. Apparently quite a few libraries in Canada already do this.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slides (pdf)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Since the conference this idea has taken off even more, but even then it was ramping up and I was interested in learning more. I haven&rsquo;t been keeping as good of track as I should and don&rsquo;t understand everything about it. My general understanding is that it is a simple microformat coupled with a simple API that allows you to move metadata for objects around. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->official site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> says &ldquo;unAPI is a tiny HTTP API for the few basic operations necessary to copy discrete, identified content from any kind of web application&rdquo;. Your best bet is to go through the examples on the site. The one thing that is clear is that there is a need for the ability to copy/paste information on the web similar to copy/paste on the desktop. There&rsquo;s also some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posts by Jon Udell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->over at Lesscode<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that may bring you up to speed on the issue.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slides (pdf)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This was another talk I was really looking forward to. If you&rsquo;ve seen OpenWorldCat then you&rsquo;ve seen some of the potential for WikiD. WikiD takes the potential of wiki&rsquo;s and adds the potential of structured data. I also have written down that it incorporates ideas of OAI repositories as well. While this thing is way too advanced for anything I&rsquo;d be playing with I got the definite impression that anyone working on digital library collections should be looking at this.</p>
<p>The whole data structure was interesting as well (if I understand it correctly). It can handle arbitrary xml schemas and it will store the data in that collection with that schema. For indexing it will use a uniform schema that you map your data to. There has also been a change apparently in SRU to allow updating. It seems like a nice example of using many of the standards that are out there (SRU/W, OpenURL, RSS, etc) and integrating them into a useful platform.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably just fed you with a bunch of misinformation so your best bet is to look through the slides, check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the project site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (use firefox).</p>

      <description>Attempting to do a group IM today with some friends turned sour due to client incompatibilies and other problems. I remembered Campfirenow being available with a permanent free account. I went ahead and registered to give it a whirl. Our chat worked out fairly well except the new Opera preview appears to not support it. After that was over I asked edsu from #code4lib to join and got the screen above.</description>

<p>Attempting to do a group IM today with some friends turned sour due to client incompatibilies and other problems.

Our chat worked out fairly well except the new Opera preview appears to not support it. After that was over I asked edsu from #code4lib to join and got the screen above.</p>
<p>My first impression is that it is a hybrid of IM and IRC with a few helpful features thrown in. The ability to jump in at any time, leave chat rooms active, browse logs, etc, is a really nice addition. It&rsquo;s also very simple to use. You can turn on guest access and then give the URL to people you want to join.</p>
<p>Another nice feature is that the accounts are only limited by number of users and space. You can create as many rooms as you want. I really see something like this being useful for small businesses or even just friends planning stuff. The obvious idea of virtual reference also comes up. A small library could easily use it for free. It would take a little bit to get a workflow but you could either start a seperate room for each person or when a person joins, lock the room so it&rsquo;s off-record and others can&rsquo;t enter. Once a patron leaves, reopen it so others can join. Sure beats some of the giant java based junk that&rsquo;s out there. IM though is probably just as good an option if not better. If you library happens to block such things or it would take too much training, this may be an option to look at.</p>
<p>For a better idea of what it is and what it does:</p>

While Yahoo gives you the portal as soon as you show up, Google seems to be going the route of only providing the &amp;ldquo;My Yahoo&amp;rdquo; type portion. I think they may keep their homepage simple while allowing those with google accounts to create their personal portal of information.</description>

      <description>Bill Drew posts about his doubts with OpenWorldCat. During code4lib2006 I got the chance to drink and complain with Eric Hellman of Openly/OCLC. Since I&amp;rsquo;m more of a patron most of my complaints were about OpenWorldCat. One of my criticisms was that it was so hard to search. If you go to worldcatlibraries.orgthen you get a nice vendor page for the product. If you go to worldcat.orgyou get a login screen.</description>

Once your on a record within it you can easily search and they do have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;demo&rdquo; page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but that&rsquo;s not the easiest to find.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to see the demo page cleaned up a bit and put at some memorable url. OCLC has been steadily improving so this may be in the works. It is possible, however, for your library to include a simple search box in a page that will fire off a search to a search engine and limit to OpenWorldCat results. Your probably asking yourself what value this has when the person is already on your library site. The first is that it advertises the service which the patron may find useful in the future if they are trying to find a book you don&rsquo;t have or a specific edition. It&rsquo;s also helpful for those who may have some problems searching the OPAC. OpenWorldCat doesn&rsquo;t have your entire catalog most likely but it could be the thing that prevents them from giving up and going to Amazon.</p>
<p>Since both Yahoo and Google have search API&rsquo;s there is the option of actually including the results into your own applications. I&rsquo;d like to see OCLC offer some API&rsquo;s of their own if they don&rsquo;t already. But to keep things simple I&rsquo;ll just show you how to create a simple search box that limits results.</p>

      <description>A good post over at Rotationalwhich aligns with how I experience things.

      <description>No this isn&amp;rsquo;t a post about our new robot overlords. It would not be wise for me to speak ill of them. In #code4libthere is a bot called panizzi that has a tendency of responding with random phrases whenever he is addressed. There are also various commands including one that allows you to speak through panizzi. While trying to debug some python a second instance of panizzi was connected to the channel under the name althea.</description>

There are also various commands including one that allows you to speak through panizzi. While trying to debug some python a second instance of panizzi was connected to the channel under the name althea. I couldn&rsquo;t pass up the chance to see if they would talk to each other. Here is a transcript:</p>
<p>[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: hello
[16:48] &lt;althea&gt; panizzi: Error: &quot;hello&quot; is not a valid command.
[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: truncating at 30 chars
[16:48] &lt;althea&gt; panizzi: Error: &quot;truncating&quot; is not a valid command.
[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: come again?
[16:48] &lt;althea&gt; panizzi: Error: &quot;come&quot; is not a valid command.
[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: please tell me more about that
[16:48] &lt;althea&gt; panizzi: Error: &quot;please&quot; is not a valid command.
[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: thankyou drive thr
[16:48] &lt;althea&gt; panizzi: Error: &quot;thankyou&quot; is not a valid command.
[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: thankyou drive thru
[16:48] &lt;althea&gt; panizzi: You&rsquo;ve given me 5 invalid commands within the last minute; I&rsquo;m now ignoring you for 10 minutes.
[16:48] &lt;panizzi&gt; althea: @dict RTFM</p>
<p>Luckily there was a ignore statement or they probably would have flooded the channel.</p>

      <title>III OPAC Hold Request URLs</title>

      <description>A terrifying title I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not graced with SuperCatwith such things like a bookbag api so I have to work with III url&amp;rsquo;s which aren&amp;rsquo;t pretty. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been requesting quite a few books through our union catalog and wondered if there was a way to easily link to the request pages. My ideal would be to set-up something similar to a netflix queue where I could easily request the next book on my list.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A terrifying title I&rsquo;m sure. Unfortunately I&rsquo;m not graced with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SuperCat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with such things like a bookbag api so I have to work with III url&rsquo;s which aren&rsquo;t pretty. I&rsquo;ve recently been requesting quite a few books through our union catalog and wondered if there was a way to easily link to the request pages. My ideal would be to set-up something similar to a netflix queue where I could easily request the next book on my list. I can link to the record pages and then click to request it but a couple less clicks would be nice.</p>
<p>For various other reasons that probably won&rsquo;t be possible with the union catalog without more work but in the process I figured out what appears to be a reusable URL structure for requests based on bib/record numbers. These URLs will take you to the request page where you enter your information or pick a location, etc. Someone else may be able to figure out how to enter your information, though be careful about how you pass PIN/passwords if required.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a sample URL:</p>
<p>http://youropac/search/.b1341013//1,1,1,B/request~b1341013</p>
<p>For some reason you have to repeat the bib number 2 times. I&rsquo;ve tried simpler combinations of the above and haven&rsquo;t been able to simplify it much without breaking it. You can also include characters between the // which is what III does but it appears to work without it. You do need the extra slash though to prevent a 404. Here&rsquo;s an example with all 3 bibs:</p>
<p>http://youropac/search/.b1341013/b1341013/1,1,1,B/request~b1341013</p>
<p>From what I can tell this does a search for the bib and then goes to the request. I can&rsquo;t seem to get it to work by going straight to the bibrecord with record=.</p>
<p>Regardless this comes in handy if your using the III XMLOpac and want to generate links for requests. Here&rsquo;s an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example using Cal State&rsquo;s XML Opac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Casey has also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->added links in his WPOpac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (in link list on right hand side of a record). Another problem is it doesn&rsquo;t seem to always load the opac template when you follow the link, at least in my browser. It does when you refresh though.</p>
<p>If anyone knows a better URL structure feel free to comment. Oh and iii&ndash;</p>

      <description>Registering for various sites bugs me but if I think the service is useful then I will usually give it a shot. I usually look over the privacy and see if there is a way to delete an account once it&amp;rsquo;s created, if possible. Another thing I look for is a way to get data out. I&amp;rsquo;m sure a service is great if I put data in, but if I can&amp;rsquo;t get it out then that worries me as I might decide to move to another site or the site might disappear.</description>

I usually look over the privacy and see if there is a way to delete an account once it&rsquo;s created, if possible. Another thing I look for is a way to get data out. I&rsquo;m sure a service is great if I put data in, but if I can&rsquo;t get it out then that worries me as I might decide to move to another site or the site might disappear. This ties in with my recent posts about backups and this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post over at Hidden Peanuts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is related to them.</p>
<p>Most &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; sites thankfully have API&rsquo;s which allow access to all your data. For example here is a post on 11 ways to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup your del.icio.us account<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are countless others. Here&rsquo;s the beginnings of an application to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup your flickr account<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (java - crossplatform).</p>
<p>These services also come in handy if something happens with your local copy such as a hard drive failure (i really need to backup my photos to dvd). As more and more of my information is web based this will become increasingly important. Already all of my email, some of my photos, most of my bookmarks and some of my lists (reading/watching/etc) are online at sites I don&rsquo;t control. I need to look into better backups for the things I do control too.</p>
<p>If your looking at the next up and coming site that you&rsquo;ll put data into, make sure you think about how you will get the data out.</p>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen Davey P&amp;rsquo;s post about the IE7 auto-detection of OpenSearch. Since I already had a 1.0 instance for our OPACI went ahead and upgraded it to 1.1 and tried it out (IE7 doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to like 1.0). It&amp;rsquo;s still just a simple xslt with the III XML server. The auto-detection worked as well as the searches I tried. Currently IÃ‚Â only haveÃ‚Â itÃ‚Â returningÃ‚Â RSSÃ‚Â thoughÃ‚Â itÃ‚Â couldÃ‚Â do ATOMÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â htmlÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â the future.</description>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My first impression was that it resembled the way Safari handles RSS feeds (which I like). I&rsquo;m also warming to the idea that this is a good move. The toolbar searches are usually for simple keywords (google, amazon, etc) and using opensearch as the backend for that just makes sense. I&rsquo;m hoping that more browsers will pick up on this idea so we no longer have to provide a Firefox search plugin, Opera search plugin, etc.</p>
<p>Another thing I like is that it makes it easy to subscribe to your search, though I could live with the information box being just a tad smaller. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to play much with the IE7 beta but it is shaping up. The sites I work on still work so that&rsquo;s the biggest thing. Will have to play more in the future. If you have the beta you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->try out my test page here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>Nothing bad happened&amp;hellip;yet. I&amp;rsquo;m currently looking into backup regimes for the department and it occurred to me the other day when gmail was getting funky that I have a lot of important information there. Other&amp;rsquo;s have apparently learned this the hard way. Luckily Gmail offers pop access that leaves the messages on the server so I just set-up a normal pop3 account in kmail and downloaded everything so I have a local copy.</description>

Luckily Gmail offers pop access that leaves the messages on the server so I just set-up a normal pop3 account in kmail and downloaded everything so I have a local copy. I could have probably just found some scripts that would do it without the full application but I wanted an easy fix for now. I might write something that I can cron later.</p>
<p>A couple of things I ran into is that for some reason kmail only downloaded around 300-400 messages each time. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is google throttling or a setting I couldn&rsquo;t find in kmail. Also remember that Gmail gives you the total conversations under All Mail, not messages. The total number of messages I had to download was much higher.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tutorial for Outlook that spurred me into action<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>One of the ideas is that of &ldquo;satisfice&rdquo; which is a cross between satisfying and sufficing. It describes the fact that many people will choose the first reasonable item instead of the best one. I was going to write about how this applies to libraries but there is no need. Roy Tennant pointed out in #code4lib that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he had already written an article for LJ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.Ã‚Â  I recommend reading the article and then reading the book.</p>

      <description>There were some questions recently about IM reference and one of the things I mentioned was running a jabber server locally and then connecting to the resources that the library needed to. One of the benefits of jabber is that the protocol is open and XML based so it is rather easy to parse and log. This gives the potential for some analysis of what is coming through to the reference desk.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were some questions recently about IM reference and one of the things I mentioned was running a jabber server locally and then connecting to the resources that the library needed to. One of the benefits of jabber is that the protocol is open and XML based so it is rather easy to parse and log. This gives the potential for some analysis of what is coming through to the reference desk. Logging could potentially be set-up so that it did not log the username of the person contacting so that it is more anonymous.</p>
<p>Well low and behold I see this may have been one of the reasons Google chose jabber as a protocol for their Google Talk. I know have a chat folder in my Gmail account that has logs of my chats (I had to turn it on) to anyone with my gmail talk account. It&rsquo;s important to note that I&rsquo;m using alternate clients that are Jabber compatible, not the official google client, so the logging is being done on the server side. They state that you can go &ldquo;off the record&rdquo; so that a contact you are talking to also does not log but since I don&rsquo;t use the official client that won&rsquo;t be possible. Since Google continues to expand their offerings such as Google Desktop and Toolbar, I can see it only being a matter of time before all your bookmarks and files are easily accessible from your Google homepage. They really are becoming the one stop search.

      <description>Over the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an increase in authors creating blogs for their books, some posting portions of their books online for input from others. This has the benefit of creating a book that meets readers&#39; needs while also building some word of mouth. Some authors are probably not as comfortable with such an active process. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly is taking this idea a step furtherand creating a revenue stream with it.</description>

Some authors are probably not as comfortable with such an active  process. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->O&rsquo;Reilly is taking this idea a step further<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and creating a revenue stream with it. You can buy into the &ldquo;rough cut&rdquo; and either get only the &ldquo;beta&rdquo; version for fairly cheap or get both the beta and the print version when it comes out. This is an interesting idea as people who don&rsquo;t buy computer texts due to the cost may be willing to buy a cheaper pdf version even if it&rsquo;s not completely finished. It also allows people to be engaged in the publishing process which may attract others. From the about page:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Rough Cuts content usually becomes available anywhere from two to six months prior to a book&rsquo;s publication. It&rsquo;s updated as the author and technical reviewers progress, so you&rsquo;ll have access to new versions as they&rsquo;re created. Chapters won&rsquo;t necessarily be written and posted in the order in which they&rsquo;ll appear in the published version.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>Regardless of your views on privacy you will likely agree that some non-identifying data keeping is ok. Things such as how many times an online journal has been used or how many times a book has been circulated. This data can be crucial in decision making. An article from OCLC in a recent Library Journal discusses this. They include some examples from WorldCat.</description>

      <description>One of the problems with comments is that you lose track of the ones you make. I usually end up googling my name with various keywords to try to find them. I&amp;rsquo;ve also thought about using bookmarking services or some sort of other software hack to track them. A new service coming out called coCommenthopes to solve that problem. Using a bookmark from the site it keeps a copy of the comments you make.</description>

      <description>One of the interesting things about tagging and tags is that it can change over time and is context sensitive. Something that might be tagged generically as politics one week could be tagged with scandal the next. The idea of of a time-based tag map for items has been discussed elsewhere and I believe there are at least a couple demo&amp;rsquo;s out in the wild.
Another service that is coming about is tag/keyword suggestions including text analysis.</description>

<p>Another service that is coming about is tag/keyword suggestions including text analysis. There are multiple services available including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TagYu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yahoo&rsquo;s Term Extraction service<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While some may argue that having suggestions changes what people tag, one of the interesting side affects is to see common themes among documents. An example just popped up that used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TagYu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recommend tags for recent State of the Union addresses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Common themes appear to be &lsquo;poverty&rsquo; and &lsquo;socialjustice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I expect more and more things related to keywords and term extraction to come about as it can help in giving relevant links to other information or just finding information that is relevant in the first place. When doing research it may be helpful to have documents linked by theme or keywords instead of just whatever document type they are. I can foresee this being easier with government documents where it may be easier to get the full text for analysis.</p>

      <description>Just came across a post over at Dan Cohen about Amazon Connect. Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s still in beta but it seems like Amazon is trying out quite a bit these days (tags, forums, etc). Amazon Connect is where authors of books can do blog like posts on their book&amp;rsquo;s page. While this is interesting in itself, what really caught my eye is that they may customize your front page to contain posts from the books you&amp;rsquo;ve bought.</description>

<p>Quite a few of my book&rsquo;s authors are blogging (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neil Gaiman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Freakonomics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc.) and I think this will allow some of the others who are not as prolific to connect with their readers. It looks like the blog is author-based and not book specific so it should be worthwhile to have the posts (new book coming out, edition, etc).  Doesn&rsquo;t look like there&rsquo;s comments enabled but I&rsquo;m not sure Amazon has a method of controlling/spam-blocking yet. It will be interesting to see where this leads.</p>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so I recommend reading the &amp;ldquo;LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s make libraries better, ok?&amp;rdquo; post over at Information Wants to Be Free. The comments are also worth reading. I think one of the take-home messages is not to cater to one group of patrons at a cost to the others.
I&amp;rsquo;m of the feeling that technology has the potential to help all groups if used well. This is especially the case with access to information.</description>

The comments are also worth reading. I think one of the take-home messages is not to cater to one group of patrons at a cost to the others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the feeling that technology has the potential to help all groups if used well. This is especially the case with access to information. During my stint as a student in education I have a few presentations to other students regarding tech in the classroom. I did my best to show the benefits of the various tools while stressing that it won&rsquo;t be a 1-fits-all. Just because parents can email you doesn&rsquo;t mean you can cancel parent-teacher night. It&rsquo;s important to know your audience.</p>
<p>I also want to point out something she brings up which I think is even more important: PR. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many library services I found out were offered only after I started working at the library. I&rsquo;m still finding things out after 4 years. Quite often I have callers that are amazed at what is offered when I inform them. Something really has to be done to publicize things more. Putting a page on your website 5 links in is not a solution. If you have to come into the library to discover it then your also not doing well. Things need to be out where people will just &ldquo;run into it&rdquo;.</p>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted much specifically about it compared to others but managed to be quoted in iy. Unfortunately it looks like my posts were misunderstood. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much of this is to blame on my writing skillz as there has been previous misunderstandings with my posts. I figured I might as well respond with what I hope is clearer.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it already there is a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cites and Insights out devoted to Library 2.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I haven&rsquo;t posted much specifically about it compared to others but managed to be quoted in iy. Unfortunately it looks like my posts were misunderstood. I&rsquo;m not sure how much of this is to blame on my writing skillz as there has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previous misunderstandings with my posts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I figured I might as well respond with what I hope is clearer.</p>
<p>The first thing Walt goes into is my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hiding Complexity post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was surpised to see it cited as a post &ldquo;about potential difficulties with a more open architecture&rdquo;. I actually opened the post with &ldquo;One of the benefits of a more open architecture&rdquo; but maybe I didn&rsquo;t back that up with the rest of the post. My hope was to show that having an open architecture would allow libraries to customize the interface to their needs, making it as complex or as simple as needed for the application. Currently in some systems you can tweak templates and remove icons but it doesn&rsquo;t have a robust system that can really push the customization.</p>
<p>The next part was that my post may have suggested that privacy didn&rsquo;t matter. That is far from what I hoped to convey and is the opposite of what I believe. I do think libraries make tradeoffs though. If your keeping records of what people have checked out then your trading some privacy as the price of business. There are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->libraries now that you can just do a cash deposit to check out the book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but that is far from the norm. If your library offers book clubs that have people read the same book then there is another privacy issue. If I know how long someone has been in the club and what books the club has read then I can probably tell what that person has been reading, even without the library keeping a patron history. But the fact of the matter is that the person has given up this privacy probably because they WANT to share what they are reading with others. The same goes for RSS of reading lists. I used to have my reading list on this site (coming back soon after some site work) because I liked the idea of showing what I was reading. Telling someone that they can&rsquo;t use RSS to show their book list due to privacy I think would be the same as telling someone they can&rsquo;t join a bookclub or tell anyone they&rsquo;re apart of it.</p>
<p>Many of the services out there have a trade-off with privacy. Some will want to make the trade-off for the service, some will not. I don&rsquo;t think this is the same as saying privacy doesn&rsquo;t matter. I think it is the service provider&rsquo;s job to make sure that the user is aware of the privacy and security issues involved. If you offer RSS feeds you should make sure the people who OPT-IN know what they are getting. If you offer patron history and recommendations then they should know what could happen, especially in this age of Patriot Act. I chose to turn on Google Search History and I knew that I was giving up some privacy. That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t care about my privacy, because I do. I want to stress that I think such services should be opt-in and I believe libraries such as AADL are doing a decent job of that so far.</p>
<p>The final portion of my section is in regards to my Talis response. I&rsquo;m still a bit confused by what Talis sees as their ideal and the library&rsquo;s place in it. Regardless Walt brings up that there are no real-world solutions made by non-vendor developers. I would argue with this saying that there are plenty of solutions currently being created by developers. If you take a look at any of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->code4lib<!-- raw HTML omitted --> people&rsquo;s blogs you will see solutions they have created for their libraries. A complete ILS? Maybe not right now but then I would say there isn&rsquo;t a real-world solution right now at all, just real-world problems that many people are working to fix (including vendors).</p>

      <description>I often see conferences I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in going to but since I use my own money I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone to any yet. When Code4LibConcame around though I decided to go ahead and signup. My vacation time is about to max out and Oregon is as good a place as any. The price for the conference is also very approachable.
The closer it is to the conference the happier I am with my choice.</description>

When <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code4LibCon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came around though I decided to go ahead and signup. My vacation time is about to max out and Oregon is as good a place as any. The price for the conference is also very approachable.</p>
<p>The closer it is to the conference the happier I am with my choice. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tentative lineup looks great<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and what&rsquo;s even better is that I was part of the process. For those that didn&rsquo;t catch it, after the proposal deadline closed voting was open to anyone who was planning on attending. We each got to choose our top 11 choices and the winners were put in the schedule. Though there will likely be some changes with drop-outs (etc) I was very impressed with the process.</p>
<p>I also think this would be an interesting idea for other conferences to pick up, especially the ones that are specialized. More general conferences may try to get a certain balance so to appeal to the most people but I think it could also be used on a per-track basis. I think there will alot of things to learn from this conference.</p>
<p>Now I just have to finish getting all my vacation stuff together.</p>

      <description>Blyberg has a nice post about AJAX. He dislikes java and I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fair share of problems with it as well. Our LMS uses it for some functions which I think would have been better suited for flash but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to refrain from a preferred format war here.
I like that he alludes that things should be degradable. I am of the persuasion that it is probably best to start with plain xhtml/forms and then add on things like ajax to increase ease of use.</description>

<p>I like that he alludes that things should be degradable. I am of the persuasion that it is probably best to start with plain xhtml/forms and then add on things like ajax to increase ease of use. Being able to do things without page loads can make certain tasks much easier but if things fail it should still work with page loads.</p>
<p>I saw a good example of this when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post about Backpack vs Gmail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came across my aggregator. Both sites were loaded using lynx. Gmail completely failed to load while Backpack was still quite usable. I also tried to load the mobile gmail in lynx and it seemed to choke on the mime-type. Of course something like this is applicable not just for lynx users but also for things such as text-to-speech/screenreaders, etc. It&rsquo;s always nice to think about how well your application will work when people access it with less then optimal set-ups. I know for a fact that quite a few Windows 95 users still access our resources and they don&rsquo;t have the latest updates either. Will your presence still be usable?</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A second post talks about barriers to information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Right now in many institutions, patrons are forced to jump through 50 flaming hoops to get anything done.

      <description> Well I might have mixed thoughts about podcasting in higher ed. I think some will get it right while others may not. I like the direction it&#39;s going though.  Apple seems to think it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen in a big way and has an integrated blog server and podcasting supportin the 10.4 OSX Server. Not sure how many use xservs but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting development.

Most studies I&#39;ve seen track number of vulnerabilities, etc but this is the first I saw that specifically looked at public non-patched ones. It gives you an idea of how many days a year you were vulnerable at the minimum, presuming you keep things up to date. This was for 2004.</description>

      <description>One of the topics covered in The Searchis the idea of vertical search engines. These are topic related search engines that search a specific part of the web (i.e. engineering, science, etc.). The book went on to suppose that the future might be in many high quality vertical search engines linked together in a metasearch.
Well today it appears Alexa has opened the doors to anyone(with a little bit of cash) to take advantage of their web crawl to build what you want.</description>

<p>Well today it appears <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alexa has opened the doors to anyone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (with a little bit of cash) to take advantage of their web crawl to build what you want.

<p>The example they give is a person who has a site devoted to cameras. He creates a subset of the crawl that has images. He then processes all the images for the EXIF information such as camera model and settings.

      <description>Was cleaning up a harddrive I moved to a linux box and wanted to get rid of all the &amp;lsquo;.&amp;rsquo; files that OSX leaves around. An easy way to list the hidden files, or so it would seem, would be:
find ./ -name &amp;ldquo;.*&amp;quot;And it would look correct. But unfortunately this also catches the filesystem pointer of &amp;ldquo;./&amp;rdquo; so if you pass it to, say rm -rf then you may recursively delete everything in that directory.</description>

<p>And it would look correct. But unfortunately this also catches the filesystem pointer of &ldquo;./&rdquo; so if you pass it to, say rm -rf then you may recursively delete everything in that directory. In order to prevent this you need to specify &ldquo;-type f&rdquo; so that it doesn&rsquo;t catch the pointer. So:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->find ./ -type f -name &ldquo;.*&rdquo; -exec rm -f {} ;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>Casey gives a good description of Library 2.0and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful. I&amp;rsquo;m in the camp that it&amp;rsquo;s a buzzword and might be overkill. However I reduce it to something really simple: change. By using the term I think it makes the statement that libraries MUST change. Admitting this can be hard for some but having an umbrella term can be helpful. Some things are already done in some cases but the discussion of the future is important and the required changes more so.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find the link but there have been multiple usability reports that state the worst thing you can do is make your site look like your organizations org chart. The BBC with all their constant updated content also has this problem. So how do they keep it usable by normal users?
A good article for anyone that is building large complex sites. Or anyone who has to deal with a site that is updated by multiple departments with various responsibilities.</description>

Some of the songs can be not work safe so you may wish to watch where you listen to it. There&amp;rsquo;s everything from classic christmas songs to rap, rock, comedy and country. You can view recent songs at their site.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a trend developing that some are calling &amp;ldquo;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s an Expert&amp;rdquo;. Some examples include Rollyo(guided search) and now Squidoo:
From first glance, what I get is that this looks like a more open, community driven version of about.com. If that&amp;rsquo;s the case then I think it may well take off. As I&amp;rsquo;ve written over at LibDev, I believe something that emulates Rollyo could be the answer to some of the metasearch problems.</description>

<p>From first glance, what I get is that this looks like a more open, community driven version of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If that&rsquo;s the case then I think it may well take off. As <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve written over at LibDev<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I believe something that emulates Rollyo could be the answer to some of the metasearch problems. Similarly I think something like Squidoo could also have it&rsquo;s place in the library.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AADL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as an example as usual, if only because they currently have a set-up that might support it. While many probably see parallels between Squidoo and subject guides, I&rsquo;m going to talk about community involvement. An example of an applicable Squidoo would be this one for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harvard Square<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Many local governments already have attractions, tourist and &ldquo;why to move here&rdquo; pages, but how many are community driven?</p>
<p>As you probably know AADL already has a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community photo project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think this could be extended to have pages about community locations or even pages by people about what you MUST SEE when you come there. Who do you trust more than the locals? They most likely already have community photos of many of the destinations. Again I picked AADL because I believe their Drupal backend will likely make this possible. Presuming the data is accessible in some sort of feed then local goverments or other community sites could pull them in. A great way of showcasing the community while getting people involved in your library.</p>
<p>Plenty of other ideas but I&rsquo;ll leave this one where it stands. The maker of Squidoo has a PDF ebook available titled &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s An Expert (about something)&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->available for download<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>For those that may still have doubts on whether portable video content will take off. Apple also just added a bunch of NBC shows including old ones like Night Rider and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. I foresee many using this sort of model to help bring back old shows from the vault. I know I have my favorites.

      <description>From the Notschool.net about page:
As a former education major (still am officially) I did quite a bit of mentoring and tutoring, especially with troubled kids. It was often the opinion of educators around me that the kids did not want to learn but in my view it was often the learning environment that failed. It&amp;rsquo;s good to see programs like this using technology and semi-structured learning environments to get kids back into learning.</description>

I own A Brief History of Time but I did actually read it, though I was once a physics major. I also have a large collection of other books I have yet to read though really want to. I suppose the difference is that no one sees my library.</description>

      <description>The 100+ Johns Talis warned us about are at it again. This time providing Enhanced Patron Historyoutside of the OPAC. What I like about this implementation is that it&amp;rsquo;s Opt-In and extensible. I have a feeling that the data will be much more usable being it&amp;rsquo;s outside the OPAC. Add on that it&amp;rsquo;s opt-in and you have a very useful service that patrons can use if they choose. I have a feeling that if this was a product that there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been that consideration.</description>

      <description>Casey did a nice post of similar thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had:
OPAC Web Services Should Be Like Amazon Web Services Ã‚Â« MaisonBisson.comI&amp;rsquo;m going to go a step further and say it should be more than the Amazon Web Service. Since Amazon is a company and has various partners the data you can get through the services are limited though they give you plenty to play with. I&amp;rsquo;ve ran into walls trying to get some of their data such as New York Times best sellers and other.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go a step further and say it should be more than the Amazon Web Service. Since Amazon is a company and has various partners the data you can get through the services are limited though they give you plenty to play with. I&rsquo;ve ran into walls trying to get some of their data such as New York Times best sellers and other. In general you can build an interface to Amazon but you couldn&rsquo;t completely recreate Amazon if you wanted to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there should be any such limitation with the OPAC though. The data is most likely yours and I think you should be able to use it how you wish. As such you should have the ability to completely recreate the OPAC if you wish. It&rsquo;s this kind of data availability that will allow libraries to keep apace with change. Unfortunately the III XML server doesn&rsquo;t currently have that sort of robust output. It allows you to so some of the simpler things but larger projects require some hacking of the OPAC itself.</p>

      <description>A match made in heaven. Truthfully though in my search for semi-healthy foods I&amp;rsquo;ll actually eat I found some Amish Apple Butter at the store. The ingredient list consisted of just &amp;ldquo;apples, applesauce or concentrate&amp;rdquo;. I was purplexed as I was certain there was more than that in it. Maybe some brown sugar.
My first thought was maybe it&amp;rsquo;s caramelized appled. A quick Wikipedia searchand it confirmed my thoughts. One of those things that I hit up wikipedia before I hit up google.</description>

<p>On a related note I just came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gollum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Wikipedia browser (ajax, etc) that gives Wikipedia an almost Encarta or desktop interface. Very interesting and since you can download the wikipedia content I can see something like this becoming a more packaged deal. How long before you have a DVD wikipedia that rivals Encarta or the rivals? The killer is that with a click of a button you can go to the updated version online and perhaps edit it if the need arises. Very interesting.</p>

      <title>Firefox Protocol Handlers</title>

      <description>This is a tip I found back when I was having various problems with external applications not working with Firefox the way I wanted. It also helps if you want to create your own protocols for testing/development, etc.
By protocol what I mean is the URL prefix such as aim:// mailto:// etc. Usually when you install a program that uses it&amp;rsquo;s own protocol prefix it will update your browser with the correct information.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a tip I found back when I was having various problems with external applications not working with Firefox the way I wanted. It also helps if you want to create your own protocols for testing/development, etc.</p>
<p>By protocol what I mean is the URL prefix such as aim:// mailto:// etc. Usually when you install a program that uses it&rsquo;s own protocol prefix it will update your browser with the correct information. On linux and OSX though I&rsquo;ve had mixed results and sometimes I want to send the information to other programs such as mplayer or VLC even on Windows. My original problem was with the Last.fm service whose radio player uses the lastfm:// protocol.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already know you can type about:config into the address bar in Firefox and get advanced settings. This allows you to highly tweak the browser if you wish. It also allows you to add custom settings which is what we need to do. The general layout is:</p>
<p>network.protocol-handler.external.protocol = boolean (true or false)
network.protocol-handler.app.protocol = /path/to/program</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that there is no need to do the external boolean in my testing just the app one. So to add the lastfm:// protocol you would go to about:config and then right-click somewhere and choose new &gt; string. You would then enter the following information:</p>
<p>Preference Name: network.protocol-handler.app.lastfm
Value: /path/to/lasfm/player (/home/ebyryan/Downloads/lastfm/player in my case)</p>
<p>For windows it would likely be the &ldquo;C:\dir\to\file&rdquo; structure while OSX would have similar syntax to above (try terminal). You will likely need to restart firefox to notice the change. I&rsquo;ve also used this to handle iTunes (itmss) protocols. If your in an internal setting where you control people&rsquo;s computers you could use this to create custom protocols for your intranet that launch specific software on the users computers when they click on items. Not sure how useful that is though.</p>

<p>If you want the perfect search though, it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s needed. I expect this sort of thing to become more prevalent in library settings as well. There are already talks of how to use the data we have to improve the search.</p>

      <description>CD-Roms with textbooks are so old school. Who has the time or want to install those things. Plus if you break the seal you can&amp;rsquo;t take the book back for a refund. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how long it takes to razor blade those things out.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see more and more publishers and educators start using multimedia and electronic formats. There are multiple electronic textbook providers though most of the ones I saw had terrible EULA&amp;rsquo;s and DRM and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a price worth accepting them.</description>

<p>For those who follow the iPod culture you&rsquo;ve also probably noticed an increase in &ldquo;ipod Edition&rdquo; of texts from cookbooks to handbooks. The best I&rsquo;ve seen though has to be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sylvius Neuroanatomical Reference / SylviusVG, iPod Edition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It uses the Notes feature of newer ipods to show you reference material. What makes it special though is that it includes images and sound pronunciation of the terms. Very nice and puts to shame the old flash cards some were probably stuck with. Add on that it&rsquo;s fairly cheap ($10 right now) and that the notes are fairly open (could probably reformat if you wanted), I think it&rsquo;s a great offering.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m not a brain surgeon but I can foresee this catching on in many classrooms especially science and language where flash cards may be used. I&rsquo;m not a fan of rote memorization but there are some that use it and some students that benefit from it (not me). Art could also benefit.</p>
<p>For those libraries with audio/visual holdings that you may want to offer this could be a possible way to do so. Offer a download that gives text and images of an event along with relevant sounds. An experience some would get from a website though now it is more portable. With the iPod video you may be able to link to video clips as well, though I&rsquo;m unsure. I&rsquo;ll have to mess around with this, many possibilities.</p>

      <description>Just rolling out (alpha/beta) but looks like an interesting service. Supports all IM services which makes me think it&amp;rsquo;s Jabber-based. More info:
immedi.atFor those that don&amp;rsquo;t know Jabber is an open IM protocol which has a nice XML structure. As such it&amp;rsquo;s nice to build things with and there are libraries for many programming languages. It took me about 20 minutes to get an old Wordpress install to IM me when someone commented.</description>

<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know Jabber is an open IM protocol which has a nice XML structure. As such it&rsquo;s nice to build things with and there are libraries for many programming languages. It took me about 20 minutes to get an old Wordpress install to IM me when someone commented. Got tired of the messages though so I got rid of it.</p>
<p>An added plus is that many people have written gateways for the various other services for jabber servers. This means if you run your own Jabber server then you can install these gateways and communicate with the other protocols but retain all the benefits of the Jabber protocol. Comes in handy for logging and other programming. If you haven&rsquo;t checked out Jabber do so. It&rsquo;s fairly easy once you get into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking of writing a Jabber interface to the III XML server if I ever get the time. Maybe someone will beat me to it ;-)</p>

      <description>Or so says the Department of Homeland Security&amp;rsquo;s US-CERT office. Good advice to say the least. If you don&amp;rsquo;t expect software then don&amp;rsquo;t accept. A bit harder when your not actually given much of a choice. Other good advice of never running as an administrator though that is rarely done due to laziness. Also read EULA&amp;rsquo;s but what I&amp;rsquo;ve read is that the Sony EULA does not actually list half the shit it does.</description>

      <description>Vendor lock-in, lack of customization and other problems are present in many software categories. There may be a solution though, for those that can&amp;rsquo;t switch providers. As you probably know Greasemonkeyallows users to fix or alter sites as they need to. This is nice but requires the user to have Firefox and the program installed. It is also a poweruser type of use.
But now there&amp;rsquo;s a server-side solution that takes the example of GreaseMonkey and moves it to the server side.</description>

      <description>While I have some more indepth ideas brewing for articles over at libdev I thought this one deserved to be posted now. In some of the discussions about Library2.0/OPAC2.0 I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people create lists of &amp;ldquo;cool technologies&amp;rdquo; that more or less included everything they used. While these technologies are all great it&amp;rsquo;s prudent to step back and think about their usefullness in the context of a library. While I use gmail, my library providing a multi-gig email service would most likely be a waste of time and resources that could be spent better elsewhere.</description>

In some of the discussions about Library2.0/OPAC2.0 I&rsquo;ve seen people create lists of &ldquo;cool technologies&rdquo; that more or less included everything they used. While these technologies are all great it&rsquo;s prudent to step back and think about their usefullness in the context of a library. While I use gmail, my library providing a multi-gig email service would most likely be a waste of time and resources that could be spent better elsewhere.</p>
<p>I was impressed to see that Michael Stephens start out one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his presentations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (pdf) with a similar discussion. He has a corresponding <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article over at Library Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->via TameTheWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m very pro-technology, specifically in it&rsquo;s use in education, I believe it&rsquo;s very important to step back and ask yourself if this technology can help you accomplish a mission or goal and be worth the time and investment. As others have stated blogs and rss have many benefits and little risk. With the multitude of free services out there I can think of almost no reason for someone to at least try it out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider another &ldquo;hot&rdquo; service though, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While I think it&rsquo;s a great service I&rsquo;d have to think harder about how it would be worthwhile to create a seperate social photo sharing service for patrons. One such possibility would be to host a gallery of local photos for the community. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AADL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has done something similar in their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pictureAnnArbor project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s important to point out that this is not a Flickr clone but instead a photo gallery system that is used as a way to connect with the community. They even use it to pull in people for in-library &ldquo;scanning sessions&rdquo;. A resource that may come in handy for prospective visitors or residents of the area. A far cry from just throwing up a photo service and seeing what happens. I can think of many more ways this could have been done wrong then right. There was some obvious thought put in.</p>
<p>Back to internet and email. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->old library<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of the first in the community to offer internet and email (was Pine/text only first and then web once it started catching on). They still offer both for free for the community which I think is thanks to the fact that Michigan has the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Merit Network<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I also get free dialup via Merit from my University. If this was beginning today I would have to say offering free email wouldn&rsquo;t be the best idea to spend resources and money on, especially if your just cloning some other service. The free dial-up is a nice service, especially for low-income users but it&rsquo;s helped by the fact that someone runs the modem pools. If the library had to run their own modem pools, etc I would probably highly discourage it.</p>
<p>Before the rambling goes on too long I&rsquo;ll just drive the points home. Think of technology in context of a mission or goal, not a goal/mission in the context of the technology. Some of us would be happy finding books. ;-)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a nice post titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Library 2.0 Perils&rdquo; over at Blyberg.net<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s worth a read.</p>

      <description>There seems to still be quite a bit of misunderstanding regarding Google Print and it&amp;rsquo;s various facets. Mostly people are confusing copyrighted works that publishers CHOSE to include and copyrighted works that were scanned from a library. In general here is a quick overview:
You can view screenshots at googleif this is still confusing. There&amp;rsquo;s a post over at SearchEngineWatch that tries to explainonce again the difference between these programs and why it&amp;rsquo;s partially google&amp;rsquo;s fault for the confusion.</description>

<p>If your confused don&rsquo;t feel bad, the AAP is just as confused (or using misinformation). USAToday responds with an article entitled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Critics should grasp Google projects before blasting them<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. The author actually also gets it wrong by stating that the results show a full page. This is only true for works where google got permission. Ones that are not opted-in don&rsquo;t even show that.</p>
<p>Hopefully things become clearer for the courts and this misinformation is addressed.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture(OpenWorldCat) and just recently finished the history/background section that went over the rise and fall of many of the options out there including Altavista, Excite, etc. The stories were often the same of a great idea either before it&amp;rsquo;s time, poorly executed (growth) or management/leadership that just didn&amp;rsquo;t understand and ended up destroying it.</description>

I&rsquo;m sure some ALA members <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can see parallels with the latter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>One of things that keeps coming up is the portal thinking and how others, who started with search, ended up ruining what they had by trying to compete with Yahoo and it&rsquo;s portal offerings. This left a void in actual search that many people wanted, which Google filled. When I got home (was reading at the laundromat) and checked my aggregator <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I came across this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think this is true for many endeavors, not just companies. Sometimes re-branding can get you by for awhile and sometimes you have to make more drastic changes to stay afloat. It seems many in the library world are afraid of such drastic changes and I wonder how it will all pan out.</p>
<p>More updates regarding the book as I get around to reading it, which will be within the next month as to avoid over due fines ;-)</p>
<p>Note for OpenWorldCat: Since you have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nice link URLs available<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it would be good to have a permalink available in the record so it can easily be linked to (I couldn&rsquo;t find one at least). I used the link Google had above so hopefully it works. I&rsquo;m not going to go to the trouble of constructing links after the trouble I have to go through just to search it.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been much a fan of Yahoo. They&amp;rsquo;re pages often seemed bloated and the services not worth the time. A big thing that prevented it from being worthwhile was the disjointedness of the services themselves. You would log in and then could go to the various services and do what you needed but the services were flat since they didn&amp;rsquo;t really take advantage of each other.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they just hired the right people, finally found the right backend or what but I think they are finally turning it around.</description>

A big thing that prevented it from being worthwhile was the disjointedness of the services themselves. You would log in and then could go to the various services and do what you needed but the services were flat since they didn&rsquo;t really take advantage of each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if they just hired the right people, finally found the right backend or what but I think they are finally turning it around. Two recent examples are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yahoo Travel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new Yahoo Maps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Yahoo Travel takes advantage of user ratings, user pictures, weather along with many other services. The big surprise is that all the information looks like it belongs and really helps the experience. In the old yahoo I remember it would have likely been links to canned searches in the other services, etc. Very nice work now. The new maps is a similar story using local information, traffic reports, etc. They also released API&rsquo;s for each individual service which makes me almost think there are backend changes going on to allow this sudden change in integration.</p>
<p>This reminds me a lot of the current online presence of many libraries. A library homepage here, OPAC there, electronic resources somewhere, etc. The services are disjointed and become confusing. I deal with quite a few patrons that just don&rsquo;t know where to look and I don&rsquo;t blame them. This landscape is changing though as more and more vendors come out with decent APIs and backends or someone hacks a way around limitations. I&rsquo;m liking what I see in many redesigns and hope for more improvement in the future. Getting something seamless though will likely require a large undertaking and perhaps a complete backend rehaul. Here&rsquo;s hoping we find a way.</p>

      <description>Search engine &amp;lsquo;best bets&amp;rsquo; at StepTwoMSUdoes this with the web search. If your term is one of the defined keywords then you get a list of official sites. It would be nice if it continued with the real results but there&amp;rsquo;s an easy link to the google search. I think they&amp;rsquo;re moving away from the internal search and just have keywords and google. At least as far as I can tell.</description>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example search: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->registrar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>For those implementing library site searches this may come in handy. It helps bring more relevant results to the top for things like checkout books, ill, borrow, renew, etc which may not be the number one result otherwise.</p>
<p>This could also be useful in the OPAC if you keep track of search terms and what books are ultimately put on hold/reserve/recall etc. It would be a bit more difficult for ones where they browse and then go to the stacks. If people are searching for a term some giving up and others finding what they need 5 pages into the results then something like this may be a possible solution. Lots of caveats in the OPAC though.</p>

      <description>There was a recent post over at TechnoBiblioregarding a recent security problemwith the SPL RSS feeds. The patrons PIN and barcode were included in the feed (URL I believe). This was a mistake due to the fact that some people use web based aggregators that allow others to see their feeds. It&amp;rsquo;s good to see that SPL recognized the problems and corrected it but it highlights a few areas that need to be considered when implementing services such as this.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent post over at TechnoBiblio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> regarding a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent security problem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the SPL RSS feeds. The patrons PIN and barcode were included in the feed (URL I believe). This was a mistake due to the fact that some people use web based aggregators that allow others to see their feeds. It&rsquo;s good to see that SPL recognized the problems and corrected it but it highlights a few areas that need to be considered when implementing services such as this.</p>
<p>One is user education. This is a new technology for many people and so they may not realize the consequences of making the data available. I use a few sites that have private feeds and they are covered in warnings about being careful about the feeds. With the increase in phishing and other problems I don&rsquo;t really think there is any technology where you can presume the user knows. What I&rsquo;ve see done for feeds is that it is marked with a lengthy random key for a URL and the user can have the key/url regenerated if they believe it has been compromised. There is also a possibility of authentication though I&rsquo;m uncertain of the support. Of course, non of this will prevent someone from using a third party site that may show their information so it is still best to have as little personal identity information in there as possible.</p>
<p>Another is privacy in general. You may be able to create great services by collecting as much data as you can and keeping the data but you need to be clear about what you are doing so patrons can make the choice. Some will want to have their data available as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibraryElf<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has shown but others would likely prefer to not have their history on file, especially with the recent library vs. feds/PATRIOT stuff going on. I believe it would be best to support both and have the data collection be an opt-in but right now I doubt few systems support conditional collection.</p>
<p>Libraries are obviously not the only ones making this mistake but it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to these issues. A privacy policy is nice but take the time to think about what data is needed and what isn&rsquo;t and where this data may end up.</p>
<p>If I sound critical it is because I&rsquo;ve had three departments in our college notify me in the last year that my information was compromised. Most of these units had no reason to have that sort of information on file. My University seems to be getting a clue now about security but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s plenty out there that haven&rsquo;t.</p>

      <description>A post about things that should be changed over at Random Access Mazarcaught my eye, especially regarding the catalogue:
I discussed this earlier in a post called Less Data means Less Search. One of the things that bothers me is the lack of more meaningful data in many of the records.

<p>I discussed this earlier in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post called Less Data means Less Search<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One of the things that bothers me is the lack of more meaningful data in many of the records. This is changing as table of contents are now regularly entered but there is still alot of old materials that have not been.</p>
<p>Right now it seems like some libraries, mine included, think that linking to a table of contents is a solution. This helps some but presumes I&rsquo;ve already found the work. As a science student many of the research works are anthologies, collected papers or books with whimsical names. This often means that I have to hope that I chose keywords in the subject or keywords chosen by the cataloger. This isn&rsquo;t always the case depending on how specialized a resource I&rsquo;m looking for and isn&rsquo;t the catalogers fault. Having the table of contents at a minimum and more data if possible helps alot in finding what I need. This is why I often look for other sites to search to start getting ideas and then use the catalog to see if we carry it. Worst case scenario I look for books that are in the general area of what I want (but not actually what I want) and try to find call number areas to browse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end the rant here but you can read the old post for more. I do want to mention that I updated the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->link to my mock-up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the old post that uses data from Amazon. Again it suffers from the same problem as above, but if we&rsquo;re going to be pulling in data we might as well pull in some reviews.</p>

      <title>The Utility of Library Blogs</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent post at Tame the Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> caught my eye. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article he links to<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has quite a few good recommendations. I&rsquo;ll address one of the quotes on TtW first:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Alone, this statement is rather misleading but was used great in the article to push the use of RSS elsewhere. RSS does not need a blog and blogs don&rsquo;t have to have RSS. Blogs make it easier to create RSS feeds and allow the ability of having a dedicated site. However, if you want to just create RSS feeds so that people can pull in content to the library homepage, courseware, etc there are desktop tools you can use to create the RSS files. It&rsquo;s often simpler to just use a free blog service though some people may find it easier to use a desktop product or prefer not to have a separate site. Some example software (I haven&rsquo;t used so no recommendations):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also tying the value of the blog with the value of the feed is also a bit pushing it. There are plenty of people who actually visit a blog to read it and not subscribe to the feed. I read too many sites to actually visit them. Also the survey results aren&rsquo;t surprising in light of other surveys out there. For example these two:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Despite this, RSS has the ability to really bring information to people even if they aren&rsquo;t aware of it. Having the ability to put timely, relevant information into courses, portals, anywhere is a boon. And this can be anything including events, announcements, etc. Our university uses RSS for their system status alerts so that the information can be syndicated on sites that need to let their users know. Mail server going down for emergency maintenance? A single update puts the information everywhere it needs to be. I currently pull the alerts in to our intranet and a portal instance as we handle the calls when there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>The article recommends the use of RSS2JS services and I have to agree. I&rsquo;ve used it on various sites (portal) due to the fact that server-side parsing was not available. I still prefer to do the parsing myself with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MagpieRSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so I don&rsquo;t depend on external services or javascript support but that&rsquo;s not always possible. The code is available for many of the JS converters so you if you can find a server to host it on then you can rest easier. Here are a few of the services out there:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you go to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more section of the first Feed2JS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there is a list of alternate services though many are ad supported. A google search for rss2js or feed2js may find more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a similar parser for podcasts and have been experimenting with pulling those into courses. If I get anything that&rsquo;s not alpha quality I&rsquo;ll try to post it.</p>
<p>I guess that the take away message, as it is in the article, is to not write-off the blog just because only a few people visit it. Use it wisely and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->USE THOSE FEEDS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you might be adding value even if you don&rsquo;t know it. There are some tips for blogging at the bottom of the article. I recommend reading the whole thing.</p>

      <description>Well if there&amp;rsquo;s one good thing about the recent slump in decent offerings from Holly wood it&amp;rsquo;s my reintroduction to quality cinema from other countries. I know some people hate subtitles but your really short changing yourself if your not seeing some of these movies. I glad the US has imported some recently (Hero, etc) instead of just making shitty remakes. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the remakes you should really see the original.</description>

<p>You can find these and more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on my IMDB vote list<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There&rsquo;s also plenty of good independent movies in the US that came out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The movie I watched most recently is called &ldquo;The Bird People in China&rdquo; which is kindof a story of old meets new, business vs old way of life, etc. I was really expecting a drama, but as in most foriegn films it&rsquo;s hard to categorize. There is drama, humor, etc. There were a couple scenes that caught me and I did some screenshots. The quality of the photography is much better than these screens show, I saved them as lower quality for the web and had my gamma slightly higher on that computer so it&rsquo;s a bit dark. I really recommend checking this out. It&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->available at NetFlix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted over at LibDev regarding standards in library systems. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be posting some more over there though I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep my rants here. Having mostly worked with open-source and similar formats it feels strange going into a world of vendor lockin and custom formats. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see others are experiencing the same and trying to work around it.
I recommend checking out darcusblogas there&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few interesting posts regarding formats.</description>

      <title>Video iPod Quality</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted I haven&amp;rsquo;t bought one yet since I don&amp;rsquo;t have USB2.0 and Firewire is no longer supported. Before it was even shipped though there were already reviews about the iPod Video having a smaller screen then it&amp;rsquo;s competitors. This is nothing new as there are constant poor reviews because of this or that feature. I was interested in seeing some actual reports.
Well Russell Beattie has a couple posts now.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted I haven&rsquo;t bought one yet since I don&rsquo;t have USB2.0 and Firewire is no longer supported. Before it was even shipped though there were already reviews about the iPod Video having a smaller screen then it&rsquo;s competitors. This is nothing new as there are constant poor reviews because of this or that feature. I was interested in seeing some actual reports.</p>
<p>Well Russell Beattie has a couple posts now. He owns both the iPod video and some of the competitors and the iPod Video is a winner even with the smaller screen. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me as Apple has always pushed quality screens in many of their products. I also have to agree that the content is the killer feature. Releasing a Video iPod without the associated content would have been ok but with the release it really puts it ahead of the competition. I&rsquo;m sure Apple could have come out with a video iPod earlier but waiting to have the TV shows, etc was a good choice. I can only see this expanding in the future.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Read his full post for even more insight (vodcasts, etc).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The second complaint I&rsquo;ve seen is the limited size of the videos. H.265 is supposed to scale well but I haven&rsquo;t seen too many tests. Again Beattie did some tests and found while not so great at large widescreen tv&rsquo;s, the output looks fine on a 32&quot; normal television. This is, of course, dependent on the quality of your source to begin with. I&rsquo;m sure some vodcasts will look like shite just due to the recording quality.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Read his full post for more review and comments.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is good to hear as it fits well with Apple&rsquo;s market. Apple has pushed home movies with iDVD, iMovie and the like. Having the ability to take your home movies easily with a ipod and dock/cables makes the experience that much better. Even if the family members you visit don&rsquo;t have a DVD player (or you don&rsquo;t have a burner) it&rsquo;s likely they have RCA jacks.</p>
<p>When various players started supporting video I thought it was cool but would likely be a nerd toy, not mass consumption. What would be the likelihood of Netflix or other studios offering worthwhile downloads. Jobs caught some slack when he stated he wouldn&rsquo;t do a video iPod but I agreed with him. But in usual Jobs style he created the market and demand. I hope it pays off and more &ldquo;official&rdquo; content keeps coming out. I&rsquo;ll be waiting patiently for my BBC world news.</p>
<p>If I can find a way to get USB2.0 I might be in the market for a new iPod.</p>

      <description>Well the iPod Video hasn&amp;rsquo;t even shipped yet and already people are converting their VODcaststo be iPod friendly or creating new &amp;lsquo;casts altogether. This could bring VODcasts into the limelight as much as the iTunes support did for podcasts.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t ordered a iPod video yet as there&amp;rsquo;s no Firewire support and I own nothing with USB2.0 or is capable of expansion to USB2.0. Thanks Apple for screwing your own customers.</description>

<p>Well the iPod Video hasn&rsquo;t even shipped yet and already people are converting their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VODcasts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be iPod friendly or creating new &lsquo;casts altogether. This could bring VODcasts into the limelight as much as the iTunes support did for podcasts.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t ordered a iPod video yet as there&rsquo;s no Firewire support and I own nothing with USB2.0 or is capable of expansion to USB2.0. Thanks Apple for screwing your own customers. I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and subscribed to some VODcasts to try it out, though. So far so good and we&rsquo;ll see how well I keep up on watching them.</p>
<p>I went ahead and ordered the series premiere of lost as well to try that out. My first impression is that it is decent quality. Unfortunately it runs like shit on my laptop. In fact it is almost unwatchable as it lags. This is the case for most videos in the new H.264 format. It seems my computer just isn&rsquo;t meant for the decoder or the new quicktime just doesn&rsquo;t handle it well. I may have to try other players when I get the chance.</p>
<p>The feeds I&rsquo;ve subscribed to so far are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacTV<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DigitalLifeTV<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the lovely ladies at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suicide Girls<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (NSFW). There is also the wonderful resource of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScreenCastsOnline<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which has screencast tutorials of Mac based stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are included in the MacTV feed so I don&rsquo;t subscribe to it on it&rsquo;s own.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: Don points out in the comments that not all screencasts are included in the MacTV feed. Will have to change my subscriptions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written previously about lecture podcasts and reserves<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and can see this applying equally well to video files of lectures. Our library currently houses lectures of some courses. If these could be digitized and offered it would be a great service. Again I question how many instructors would like such a thing and the ones that do probably won&rsquo;t go through the library. It unfortunately seems like many only think of libraries when it comes to the old-skool things and not with the emerging technology. Hopefully that will change as having things segmented by department or even teacher can make it hard for people to find things unless they are directly involved. I doubt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MIT&rsquo;s OpenCourseWare<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would have been a success if professors decided to post their content to their own homepages instead. The library is one possible central location for such information.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t dabbled in VODcasts then give it a whirl. You don&rsquo;t need a portable video player to enjoy it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Newsday has an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on lecture podcasts and includes the student opinion that vodcasts would be nicer. A good read.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure everyone else already knows but Wordpress also moved to Subversion and Trac. Fairly easy to keep track of development and bug fixes in my favorite blog/cms. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already check out the timeline. Might come in handy for those who are wondering if some bug is fixed already and most likely a diff if you want. Can also check out builds back to 1.5 not that you would want to.</description>

      <title>Delivery Services - The Only Thing I Hate About Shopping Online</title>

      <description>I love shopping online. The only thing I really buy offline is food and if I lived in an area large enough to have online groceries, I would certainly buy them online too. There is just too much convenience and I just hate the offline shopping experience. There are occasions that I like seeing something in person but I usually then go home and buy it online once I&amp;rsquo;ve made the decision.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love shopping online. The only thing I really buy offline is food and if I lived in an area large enough to have online groceries, I would certainly buy them online too. There is just too much convenience and I just hate the offline shopping experience. There are occasions that I like seeing something in person but I usually then go home and buy it online once I&rsquo;ve made the decision. Usually I base my decisions on what people say in blogs, amazon, etc. I never try clothes on so there is really no reason for me to go shopping.</p>
<p>What I do hate is getting shit delivered once I buy it. As someone that works evenings (4pm to Midnight) I find that the services are not set-up to work with me. Actually my schedule probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, the services just suck. I&rsquo;d get my packages delivered to work but for obvious liability reasons that is not allowed. Luckily I live in an apartment complex so I have an office that will sign for packages. Or at least they would if the assholes would leave it there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>FedEx has apparently adapted to people working 8-4/9-5 by showing up at my door at 7am. As someone who doesn&rsquo;t usually hit the sack until 2-3am this is inconvenient. I assure you I am not getting out of bed for anything at 7am. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s Ed McMahon with a check. They also will not leave a package that has to be signed with the office. This means if I want my package I need to pick it up myself. If it doesn&rsquo;t require a signature then they just whip it at my door, which is also unfortunate as my door is right by everyone&rsquo;s mailboxes. Packages have disappeared. There is also no protection from the weather.</p>
<p>I refuse to sign any sheets for FedEx as both times I did they gave me a package that was supposed to be delivered to somewhere in Asia, then argued that I had signed for it and it was, therefore, my responsibility and I was liable. I assure you this did not hold forever but I don&rsquo;t want to go through the experience again.</p>
<p>I will give them credit for coming back later in the day one time. I worker appeared to be new and still learning so I&rsquo;m sure that won&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>UPS appears to take the opposite approach for the workday and shows up between 4-5 which is when I&rsquo;m starting my workshift. Luckily, if I leave a note, they usually will leave it at the office. Unfortunately, the office closes at 6 so it&rsquo;s hit or miss whether they get over there in time.</p>
<p>This would be my preferred service but my packages seem to disappear off the face of the earth too often. Usually they appear to be signed for in Texas. I have suspicions that these mis-deliveries aren&rsquo;t accidental but I&rsquo;m too lazy to collect evidence. Also, Amazon is awesome with it&rsquo;s replacements. Overall I&rsquo;m OK with the UPS service as they will at least deliver the package, if not always to me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Despite how many people seem to dislike the mail service, I still prefer them as my delivery though not much more than UPS. The driver comes at around the same time each day (noon-1pm) which is a good time for me and will leave it with the office if need be unless some special signature stuff was asked for. Usually if I authorize it though they will leave it. They do have the problem with leaving packages next to my door if no signature proof is required though. They also tend to do more attempts and have a convenient location in the odd chance I need to pick it up. FedEx and UPS have their centers way the hell out of town.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bring this up because I just bought some books from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and of course got the uneasy feeling in my stomach anticipating what hell I would be going through to get my order but alas it came through USPS and I got them without much trouble at all. They were left at my door again though. Amazon boxes are a tad too easy to pick out and I can see someone grabbing it thinking it was DVD&rsquo;s etc. Oh well.</p>
<p>BTW, the books I got were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anansi Boys<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by my favorite author <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neil Gaiman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Freakonomics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I already had the audiobook from iTunes but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one of the authors is coming to town<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and thought I&rsquo;d get something signed. The authors <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also have a blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>As announced elsewhere, WorldCat now supports user additions such as reviews, notes and tables of contents. The original post stated that it was Wiki functionality though I didn&amp;rsquo;t see that, as others in the comments noted. It&amp;rsquo;s been updated to stated that it has a Wiki backend and supports Wiki Markup though I don&amp;rsquo;t see either of those either. For this review I will presume there is absolutely nothing Wiki-related and focus on other things.</description>

For this review I will presume there is absolutely nothing Wiki-related and focus on other things.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that I was required to login to add content. This makes sense and I was happy to see that I could login with my WebJunction information. FirstSearch usernames are also allowed which works since only libraries that subscribe to FirstSearch are in OpenWorldCat now, or so it says <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the homepage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Overall the interface is clean and easy to use and the features are nice. It&rsquo;s important to note that my library appears to have holdings covered in it, so it may be more useful for me that others. Having said that I think there are plenty of areas where it could grow and here&rsquo;s some of my ideas for reference.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->IANAL: I am not a librarian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am looking at this as an outsider. What some call &ldquo;a patron&rdquo;. As such I have no real idea the politics, service agreements, purpose or otherwise behind WorldCat or more specifically OpenWorldCat. What I list below may not be feasible or go against the purpose of said project. Won&rsquo;t stop be from spewing opinions though.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I guess as it stands it seems like a nice service but I don&rsquo;t really see the point of using yet. Yes, it&rsquo;s nice if someone searches for a book title in a search engine they get the option of searching in a library, but it seems like a waste of such a large undertaking for just that. Hopefully they have plenty of things cooking for the future. But if they are going to try to add these features they should really try to make the service more public and easier to access or I don&rsquo;t think it will take off.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: There&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post at Outgoing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that goes over the wiki capabilities. Nice to see though linking seems to be discouraged in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->content guidelines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it until today but Yahoo has a podcast site now.Makes sense with the My Yahoo and their music offerings. Yahoo tends to be about content and with the recent additions and changes I see this becoming more so. Kind of reminds me of AOL.
The one thing I really have to diss about the Yahoo offering is that it asks me to signin if I click on the download link.</description>

<p>The one thing I really have to diss about the Yahoo offering is that it asks me to signin if I click on the download link. I don&rsquo;t think this is right as it&rsquo;s using other people&rsquo;s content to push their own service, and some probably have copyrights that probably forbid this. Odeo, and the other sites I&rsquo;ve seen, link straight to the file. I went ahead and logged in and Yahoo does link to the files on the providers' website, so I don&rsquo;t really see why they are forcing sign-ins. Just doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me.</p>
<p>My thoughts are that it seems like a bit of a clone of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Odeo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with a shittier interface. I guess since iTunes had podcasts it won&rsquo;t take long for the other music services to follow suit. As it stands now I&rsquo;ll stick with Odeo synced to iTunes. Nice interface and very easy to use, especially the queue system.</p>

      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;m finally using version control for my web projects. As you may know I recently started using Gregarius, and the SVN version thereof. Subversionwas fairly easy for me to pick up and had some very useful features. Since I had subversion installed I went ahead and created my own repository for my projects.
I had planned to do similar quite awhile ago after reading a series of articles on managing web projects.</description>

As you may know I recently started using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gregarius<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the SVN version thereof. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Subversion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was fairly easy for me to pick up and had some very useful features. Since I had subversion installed I went ahead and created my own repository for my projects.</p>
<p>I had planned to do similar quite awhile ago after reading a series of articles on managing web projects. I recommend giving them a read:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Subversion itself is useful, but add-on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it&rsquo;s wonderful. At first I doubted whether this would even be worth it. Being a one man shop and doing internal projects made me think that just coding it would be enough. Version control was something for large, distributed projects. Using Trac at the Gregarius site and seeing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the review at 0xDecafbad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> convinced me to give it a whirl. It did take a little bit to get used to but it&rsquo;s already coming in handy. Being able to run a simple command and seeing what I&rsquo;ve changed is more helpful then I thought. I can now run my dev version and create patches for the live version with ease instead of overwriting it like I used to. If I happen to screw something up I can easily go back to whatever version I need.</p>
<p>Trac itself has a ticket system, wiki and nice tracking features (timeline, etc.). Again I thought this as overkill as how many bugs I find would be minimal, but the documentation gave the idea of using it to track everything about the project. I now use the ticket system to track what features I want along with bugs and the like. I assign the features to milestones/versions and assign a priority. It lets me easily see what features I want and how they are fairing. I can easily re-prioritize things and keep track of the big picture. I&rsquo;ve only had it going for a few days but it&rsquo;s already working well for me.</p>
<p>I have my install behind authentication due to the projects being work/internal. To get an idea check out of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Gregarius install<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

      <description>What was going to be a search add-on for Safariis now available as a beta website. Combines instant search, suggestions and supposedly multiple search engines though right now that just appears to be links to elsewhere, not actually merged in the results. Uses google right now, which is not surprising since they already had a instant search interface.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen various trials in libraryland for similar &amp;ldquo;instant searches&amp;rdquo;. This one has a nice merged interface.</description>

      <description>A new service is available called Tagyu. A suggestion engine for tags. You can put it a URL or text and it will give you some suggested taggings based on others. Del.icio.usalready gives suggestions now so I probably won&amp;rsquo;t use it much. A wordpress plugin suggesting tags (technorati) for posts would be nice, though I&amp;rsquo;ve been too lazy to tag posts lately. Web Service for Tagyu is coming soon according to the FAQ.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite radio shows, and now podcast, is In Our Timesfrom BBC Radio 4. They&amp;rsquo;ve started their new season with an episode on Magnetism. How did I find out? iTunes downloaded it. One of the great things about podcasts is the ability to &amp;ldquo;set it and forget it&amp;rdquo; as Ronco would say. Some have a regular schedule but things that are season-based can be more troublesome to keep up on.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite radio shows, and now podcast, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Our Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BBC Radio 4<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They&rsquo;ve started their new season with an episode on Magnetism. How did I find out? iTunes downloaded it. One of the great things about podcasts is the ability to &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ronco would say<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Some have a regular schedule but things that are season-based can be more troublesome to keep up on. You can subscribe to their mailing list but I try to keep my email subscriptions to a minimum. A caveat: the mp3&rsquo;s are only available until the next episode comes out (podcasting is still in trial phase) otherwise you have to stream realplayer. You can dump the real stream to mp3 using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mplayer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if need be but I&rsquo;ll leave that to you.</p>
<p>On a related note the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web Essentials 2005 Podcasts are up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (some link to slides too). Tons of great presentations and the quality is great. I&rsquo;m a big fan of conferences that post audio and preferably slides of their presentations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ITConversations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a godsend, especially for someone that can&rsquo;t afford to go to these conferences. The Duke Podcasting Symposium <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has webcasts up now of sessions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the library conferences, even the tech ones, seem to lag behind. The conference sites themselves are often confusing and there is no central place where people post their slides, etc. Some organizations even have them behind a authentication scheme where you have to be a member to get them. The recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chicago ALA Wiki<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a breath of fresh air though that was more grassroots than officially ordained. I was thinking of going to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Internet Librarian 2005<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but just can&rsquo;t swing it this year for various reasons both work and financial. I have my doubts on how easy it will be to find slides besides what&rsquo;s linked to by blogs I follow. I won&rsquo;t hold my breath for audio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say that if anyone is organizing a conference or working on a conference site, please take the time to think about presentations, etc. See what presenters would be willing to submit them, etc. If you can throw together the audio part then that&rsquo;s even better. Just a thought.</p>

      <description>As you probably noticed the old ebybox domain is now redirecting to my own. I used to use a subdomain from a friend for my server as it was free. I went ahead and got my own domain since it&amp;rsquo;s so cheap these days and I wanted to have some subdomains of my own. You will now notice that my blog is at blog.ryaneby.com
Thanks to apache redirects you should be able to access all old links from the old domain.</description>

      <title>Mint: Some Tasty Stats</title>

      <guid>https://ryaneby.com/2005/09/mint-some-tasty-stats/</guid>
      <description>I used to use various stat programs such as AWStats, Webalizer, etc but they were just overkill for what I needed. They also weren&amp;rsquo;t very nice to look at though the data was comprehensive. Eventually a program called ShortStatcame out and I switched to that. It gave me the basic information I needed without all the fluff and was in a easy to read/use format.
Well the successor, Mint, came out recently and I went ahead and bought it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to use various stat programs such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AWStats<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Webalizer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc but they were just overkill for what I needed. They also weren&rsquo;t very nice to look at though the data was comprehensive. Eventually a program called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ShortStat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came out and I switched to that. It gave me the basic information I needed without all the fluff and was in a easy to read/use format.</p>
<p>Well the successor, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mint<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, came out recently and I went ahead and bought it. My site gets little traffic (100 hits a week or so) so the $30 price tag was a bit high for me. On the other hand I was tempted many times to make a donation for ShortStat so I think of it as a split purchase. Either way I&rsquo;m very happy with the results. It has everything I liked about ShortStat with addition of so much more. By much more I don&rsquo;t mean as much as AWStats, etc though you can practically make it that much if you want to using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pepper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> add-ons. More about those later.</p>
<p>The first big improvement I like is the fix for referrer spam. My ShortStat was plagued by referrer spam as was everything else I&rsquo;ve tried. Mint uses javascript to help weed out some of the robots. I&rsquo;m sure someone will make a robot that can parse javascript but for now it works great. The various levels of display for referrers (repeat, recent, unique) are also helpful. The downside of this protection is I don&rsquo;t see people accessing the site with javascript turned off but that&rsquo;s not a biggie for me.</p>
<p>The next thing I like are the search displays. I get an easy view of what searches are leading to my site and what searches people perform at my site. The latter is a very nice addition and is split into common and most recent as is the other. A plus is that it works with Wordpress without doing any changes to Wordpress. I just entered a &lsquo;/&rsquo; and &rsquo;s' in the Pepper config and off it went.</p>
<p>And then there are the Pepper add-ons. Right now I only have one installed which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->outclicks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This tracks what links people are clicking on to leave my site. I plan on installing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->error tracker one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the near future as error pages was originally why I ran the larger stat programs. With the addition of that I think I will have pretty much everything I want and no more. I can disable modules at will if I please so I only have what I want.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->An additional plus, for me at least, is that the default doesn&rsquo;t appear to track IP addresses, though <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there is a Pepper to do so<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: While moving mint to my new domain I took a look at the database and it does indeed track IP&rsquo;s. Oh Well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is a plus as (supposedly) our library has a policy of not logging information for our websites that may contain IP addresses as part of our policy. I question if this is actually the case but as someone in a department I only have access to hit counts and no other information. This makes it difficult to plan redesigns, etc as I have no information on what people are using to access the site or what they are doing at the site. I may be talking to some people to see if I can get some minty goodness going and still stay in our privacy policy.</p>
<p>Overall I say this product was worth every cent and I use it many times a day. If you are looking for a simple stats program that gives you what you want and only what you want then give it a try. Below is a screenshot of part of my set-up. The thumbnail links to a full-sized image which is rather large (1234x822 180k).</p>

      <description>For awhile now Apache2 has been giving me the following warnings:
I finally got off my ass and figured out that the problem was that each of my virtual host files had the NameVirtualHost *:80on the top of it. I had created one virtual host and had used it as a template for the others. I moved the declaration to the actual apache config before it loads the virtual host configs and that got rid of the error.</description>

There&rsquo;s some nice bullet-points at the bottom, so be sure to read them.</p>
<p>I often see some confusion when these things come up so I want to run through some common misconceptions as I know many don&rsquo;t follow DRM like I do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bring these up but I often see confusion in the debate of AAC vs whatever and find that some people get confused by it. Personally I&rsquo;d prefer an open format such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ogg Vorbis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but I&rsquo;ve come to the realization that open formats tend to get shit on unless someone big starts pushing it. I&rsquo;m still waiting for my iPod to support Vorbis. I could care less about WMA support and would prefer they don&rsquo;t as I&rsquo;m in the camp that belives that codec should be put to rest.</p>
<p>A nice story I came across today though is that of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fox responding to fan complaints about the DRM in the online only FireFly soundtrack by releasing mp3 versions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to those who bought it. I&rsquo;ve never seen Firefly but was tempted to purchase the soundtrack just because of this gutsy move. It&rsquo;s rare to see a media outlet do such a thing. Maybe if enought library patrons complain something will be done about audiobooks.</p>
<p>As a caveat I should mention that I own a iPod and have purchased both music and audiobooks from the iTunes store. I wouldn&rsquo;t have done this though except that Fairplay is easily circumvented so I had no trouble listening to my purchases at work on my linux desktop.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen various posts on the internet regarding higher education podcasts, including lectures. Came across one on diggtoday about a University of Michigan department actually offering private podcasts through the iTunes music store to students. They state it&amp;rsquo;s a partnership with Apple. An interesting development and I think a slightly better partnership than the Napster shit some colleges are doing. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in seeing how much piracy that supposedly prevents but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for another day.</description>

Came across one on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->digg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today about a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->University of Michigan department actually offering private podcasts through the iTunes music store to students<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They state it&rsquo;s a partnership with Apple. An interesting development and I think a slightly better partnership than the Napster shit some colleges are doing. I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing how much piracy that supposedly prevents but I&rsquo;ll leave that for another day. Partnering to offer actual content from the university is a nice step. I&rsquo;d prefer it be open to all but know that many professors and universities are yet to that stage of openness. (I&rsquo;m a big fan of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MIT&rsquo;s OpenCourseware<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<p>With such partnerships occurring I&rsquo;m wondering how long it will be before I can log into the iTunes store and check out audiobooks my library subscribes to? iTunes already has content from Audible though they would have to do some changes to take care of checkout periods, etc. Will be interesting to see how things develop.</p>
<p>Another question, are any libraries doing &ldquo;podcast reserves&rdquo; of lectures? We offer some audio/video tapes of lectures here though I&rsquo;m uncertain how many professors would like their information online. We&rsquo;ll wait and see.</p>
<p>BTW, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thomson Peterson&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has quite a bit about syndication in higher ed.</p>

Since I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed some other things I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go over the systems I use, not that anyone would care. Here they are anyways with some mini-reviews of each.</description>

If you are looking for Gentoo/portage for OSX then you&rsquo;ll probably want to take a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look at this how-to at the Gentoo Wiki<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve reviewed some other things I thought I&rsquo;d go over the systems I use, not that anyone would care. Here they are anyways with some mini-reviews of each.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gentoo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be a bit more difficult to install that some distros(I believe they are working on an installer), the amount of tweaking and customization it allows is amazing. It&rsquo;s possible to have the entire system compiled from source so that it is optimized for your hardware. I&rsquo;m personnally still a newb when it comes to linux and cringe at the idea of compiling something from scratch, but the emerge/portage system makes this so easy I think it&rsquo;s really a great distro even for a newb. Optimizing and tweaking does require some know-how.</p>
<p>The real winner here is how much documentation they have online. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Online Handbook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> coupled with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gentoo Forums<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is pretty much all you will ever need. I&rsquo;ve yet to have a question that wasn&rsquo;t answered somewhere in there. It&rsquo;s these kind of resources that really make the product and other distros should take note. If you got a spare harddrive or computer then give it a whirl.</p>
<p>As for desktop environments I&rsquo;m currently using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gnome<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though I&rsquo;ve used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->KDE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the past. It&rsquo;s rather easy to switch so I might do so in the future depending on what come&rsquo;s out. One of the joys of using Linux is choice, though this can be a hinderance to some as they don&rsquo;t know what to choose.</p>
<p>As a side note I find that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CrossOver Office<!-- raw HTML omitted --> runs pretty much all the Windows applications I&rsquo;m still stuck using here at work including Office 2000/XP (2003 not yet supported).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well I caught the Apple bug after I purchased an iPod back in 2002 and soon purchased an iBook. I&rsquo;ve been very happy ever since. As far as desktop environments go I don&rsquo;t think anything comes close to OSX. Gnome and KDE are great and are getting better, but I&rsquo;m still the happiest with OSX. Yes, there&rsquo;s unneeded eye candy, like WinXP but unlike WinXP it actually runs decently and I&rsquo;ve found that each new release actually runs better on the same hardware! The first thing I do when I&rsquo;m at a WinXP station is turn off all the eyecandy, though I prefer to find a station that still has Win2k on it.</p>
<p>Overall it just works, the applications available are great and if I need a bit more control there are still BSD underpinnings. This comes in handy when you administer linux servers, which brings me to..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While Gentoo is great, especially if you want bleeding edge, there&rsquo;s something about the stability of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Debian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that keeps me using it. I&rsquo;ve had my server running for at least 3 or 4 years now without a crash or problem. The only downtime I&rsquo;ve had is upgrading kernels and the occasional act of god (power outage, powersupply failure, etc). The ease of updating with apt is probably the killer feature. I have to say of the distro&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve tried, the easiest to maintain for servers has to be Debian. If you want to run a small development box or host your website or whatever, I highly recommend giving it a try. I run mine on a old 400Mhz P2 and it hasn&rsquo;t let me down yet.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary with the above but they&rsquo;re the ones I&rsquo;m sticking with.</p>

      <description>Awhile ago I had some data lose on some library servers. I had presumed that the data had been backed up by those running the server. No more. I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly implementing backup procedures for the various servers my department has data on. Still got a lot of work to do.
Well two days ago another server crashed (hdd failure) and, big surprise, the supposed backups failed. Luckily I had a copy of our stuff to put back up.</description>

I&rsquo;ve been slowly implementing backup procedures for the various servers my department has data on. Still got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Well two days ago another server crashed (hdd failure) and, big surprise, the supposed backups failed. Luckily I had a copy of our stuff to put back up. The other departments&hellip;probably not as lucky. I house my backups on my server (this one) and thought to myself, damn I better make sure everything is backed up onto a third computer. I also better make sure that the blog and sites and everything are currently backed up.</p>
<p>Well long story short I went to backup this site and bam, hard drive failure. At least I thought so as there were DMA timeout errors. It ended up being a bad cable from the power supply. Switched cables and ebybox is back in business. What amazes me is that ebybox is around 7 or 8 years old (400Mhz P2) and still running on the original hardware, including harddrives. This was a computer I put together myself so it has a bit better hardware than some.</p>
<p>My friends? Not so lucky as they have mostly newer harddrives which seem to drop like flies every few months. It used to be that there were certain brands you could trust but now adays it seems your gambling when you choose a drive and if your lucky it&rsquo;ll last. I&rsquo;m afraid to upgrade the drives in my server as I just don&rsquo;t trust any of the current ones out there (unless you drop some big moolah for enterprise level drives). I&rsquo;m all for increasing capacity but at least make it so I can trust putting shit on the thing. My friend had 3 large drives in a RAID and they all went at once. Kind of hard to recover data from that.</p>
<p>Well the lesson here is back shit up. Not only that but do it to different computers. I may be looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Strongspace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here in the future once we start putting more critical operations online. I apologize for the downtime. There may be more in the future if I end up having to replace the power supply.</p>
<p>Update: A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->timely article at Mezzoblue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was setting up rsync at the time this came across.</p>

      <title>Gregarius - An Online Aggregator</title>
      <link>https://ryaneby.com/2005/09/gregarius-an-online-aggregator/</link>

      <guid>https://ryaneby.com/2005/09/gregarius-an-online-aggregator/</guid>
      <description>Back in the early days of RSS I tended to use desktop aggregators as they worked the best. As my job changed and I was switching between work and home computers I found it problematic to have it at only one location. Eventually the web-based aggregators matured and I signed up at bloglines. I was very happy with the service but prefer to host things myself if possible so I have more control and can tweak things to work the way I want.</description>

As my job changed and I was switching between work and home computers I found it problematic to have it at only one location. Eventually the web-based aggregators matured and I signed up at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bloglines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was very happy with the service but prefer to host things myself if possible so I have more control and can tweak things to work the way I want. Having the search/data local is also a plus as I found the bloglines search not working well for me.</p>
<p>I can finally do this thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gregarius<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The default layout is very bloglines-ish which is nice and it tends to work much better than bloglines itself. I was having a lot of problems with bloglines lately with their javascript based feed list. It&rsquo;s also themeable so I can tweak things as I like. The features and feed updating are great and it easily handles my 300+ feeds with ease.</p>
<p>The product alone isn&rsquo;t why I&rsquo;m recommending it, but instead the development side of things. The first install of the program was not fun as it used php short tags which I have disabled (do alot of xml work). This forced me to search and replace through many files and was sometimes hard to track down. Once I got it working I went ahead and checked out the dev site and saw that some of the tags were fixed. I reopened the ticket to have the short echo tags updated and I&rsquo;d say it wasn&rsquo;t a day or two later that it was fixed. I now run the SVN version of it and love it.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t had time to tweak the theme how I want but if you are looking for a aggregator for either yourself or work then give Gregarius a whirl. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. I highly recommend checking out the SVN version or downloading a nightly as there are plenty of fixes and it still seems to work great.</p>
<p>BTW. If you are only tracking a few feeds you may prefer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lilina<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. With the number of feeds I track the display just wouldn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

      <description>Mix quick transit with a highly contagious disease and what do you get? Massive death. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking a simulation but an actual virtual plague that has broken out on some World of Warcraft servers. I haven&amp;rsquo;t logged in lately so am unsure if it has occurred on my realm but the dynamics are interesting.
There&amp;rsquo;s a new high end instance that has mobs that can infect you with Corrupted Blood.</description>

I&rsquo;m not talking a simulation but an actual virtual plague that has broken out on some World of Warcraft servers. I haven&rsquo;t logged in lately so am unsure if it has occurred on my realm but the dynamics are interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new high end instance that has mobs that can infect you with Corrupted Blood. This is a somewhat shortlived disease that is contagious to those around you. A interesting edition to an instance that would normally make things more difficult. The problem arises because players can teleport to major city&rsquo;s while still infected. The disease then spreads like wildfire and can easily kill lower level players.</p>
<p>This would be the end of the story except that NPC (non-player characters) can also be infected. They are also likely to survive it. It can also spread to pets, etc. An epidemic in the making. Supposedly GameMasters tried to quarantine infected players to no avail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be really interesting to see if any epidemiologists do a study on this. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE: There&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->story at NPR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the possibility of studying the responses of players to epidemics online. While the disease may not behave like a real one, the humans involved may act similar to real life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <description>The web is abuzz with the new Yahoo mail. Looks like a very nice implementation of a email application online. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with gmail since my yahoo account was closed due to the amount of spam I was getting. I have an inkling that yahoo was behind some of it. I also prefer the label approach over folders. It was the main reason I moved to Gmail.
I do wish that Microsoft would do something about the webmail interface for Exchange servers.</description>

<p>I do wish that Microsoft would do something about the webmail interface for Exchange servers. We have one at work and it sucks if you use anything other than IE. They even make it so you can&rsquo;t set preferences unless your using IE. That is just retarded.</p>
<p>If you like some of the features of the yahoo mail such as drag-and-drop and have access to an IMAP server then you might want to install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RoundCube Webmail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on a server and try it out. I used it to access the exchange server via IMAP and it worked great. Has some CSS issues with Safari and I can&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to connect to a IMAP that requires SSL but the planned features are impressive. Plus it&rsquo;s opensource.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to see how many of the interface elements that were relegated to the desktop be implemented in browsers on the web.</p>

      <description>Some iPod news today. Firstly the iPodLinux group got video with sound working. Even includes a converter for those of us sad people stuck with greyscale screens. I still don&amp;rsquo;t trust myself to install linux on my iPod. If I ever upgrade though I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure my old one will get it installed.
Secondly is that someone got SLAX, a small liveCD that can be booted off a USB drive, working on a iPod nano.</description>

<p>Secondly is that someone got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SLAX<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a small liveCD that can be booted off a USB drive, working on a iPod nano. He <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted a detailed tutorial on it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What I like about this is that the iPod is still usable on it&rsquo;s own, you just happen to have a bootable OS on it.</p>
<p>My current iPod only has Firewire (generation 2) which the library computers don&rsquo;t have. I have installed OSX on it before and booted to it on the library G5&rsquo;s but I have a PC in my office. I like the idea of one day being able to carry everything around with me in my pocket. It only a matter of time before someone has it so you can boot into linux where the data in encrypted on the iPod. I could then have a thin client and home and work and just boot the same OS at both places. Since the iPod can be mounted as a disk I can also access my files from computers I can&rsquo;t boot too depending on whether I encrypt or not. I use linux on my work computer so it wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a change. Not that information on how to get it bootable I could really use any distro.</p>
<p>I already use my iPod as a portable harddrive. I think I might be using it as a portable OS in the future.</p>

      <description>An interesting data visualizationbeing done at the Seattle Central Library involving items that are being checked out. In this case it is an art installation but I can see this being cool in any library.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the new design of the librarythough. The building itself looks great but the inside looks too industrial/trade show for me. Does not look warm and inviting compared to some of the other libraries I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.</description>

      <description>Came across this through various blogs so you&amp;rsquo;ve probably already seen it. What I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is Paragraph, a loft/gym type area for writers in NYC. You sign up for a membership and in exchange you get an environment where you might be able to get some writing done.
I like the idea alot though I think the WiFi would distract me from actually accomplishing anything. Back when I attempted to pass classes I would often spend my days and/or nights at the campus libraries off in a corner working on various things, listening to the iPod.</description>

<p>I like the idea alot though I think the WiFi would distract me from actually accomplishing anything. Back when I attempted to pass classes I would often spend my days and/or nights at the campus libraries off in a corner working on various things, listening to the iPod. I find being home or in a dorm or elsewhere to be distracting especially if there is internet or other things available. Coffee shops were also a big stop though they are more crowded than the libraries.</p>
<p>Now that I work in a library setting I find myself showing up early or staying late in order to get things done. If I lived in a busier area such as NYC I think a place like this would be great. From the pictures it looks like a great atmosphere though depending on how many people start using it it could become overwhelmed. An oasis in the urban jungle it could be.</p>
<p>I have quite a few friends that are writers and we threw around the idea of doing such a thing around here though I don&rsquo;t think the market is large enough. Coffee shops are booming around here though so who knows. I only bring this up as there is a big push in library design/redesign for creating an environment that is conducive to learning/studying/writing/etc.</p>
<p>My only request is cheaper quality coffee at the library cafe. I roast my own so I know what the beans cost.</p>

      <description>The EFF has written a nice plain language write-up regarding the various online music services. Lets you know what rights your giving up. Right now I occasionally buy songs from the iTunes store. This is mostly because it&amp;rsquo;s a decent audio format (mpeg4) and the DRM is easily stripped. If either of these change then I&amp;rsquo;ll likely stop buying.

      <description>Great to see a client that usesJabberbeing pushed. Finally I get to use a server where I might actually remember my password. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly moving away from AIM/MSN and the other closed protocols. I might move my jabber contacts over to the google server. Not sure who they use for voice. I&amp;rsquo;m still going to use Skype for now. I&amp;rsquo;m using Gaimand Adiumas my IM clients though.

      <description>With all the recent hubbub over Google Print, here&amp;rsquo;s a company that gets it. Sell short exclusive works for cheap since there are almost no distribution costs. Lots of self-publishing is coming about and this looks like something that might work as well, even for the authors that could sell print if they wanted.
Update: A author discusses the program. More discussion in the comments of the post as well.</description>

      <description>What would a bunch of producers and personalities do when locked out of the CBC? Well, podcast their shows instead. A few have taken to the internet to keep connected with their audience and tell their side of the story. More at the site below.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen various versions of TiddlyWiki around the internet, all of them interesting. What caught my eye about this one is the data format. RSS is used for versioning and data storage. You can of course subscribe to the same feed to track changes. Very interesting use. It currently uses RSS 2.0 though I&amp;rsquo;m sure it could be changed to the format of your choice if you wanted to.

If your OPAC offers RSS feeds of search results why not offer this printer-friendly version for them to save. Not much in terms of customization yet. Here&amp;rsquo;s one for genetics from our library:

      <description>When podcasts/ipodder began I started listening to podcasts. At that point there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many though it was starting to grow. I found that having a separate application was just too much for me and so I rarely updated/downloaded the podcasts.
With the release of iTunes w/ podcasting supportI&amp;rsquo;ve begun again and I have to say this time I think it will stick. Having it update automatically in iTunes itself and with the iPod support it just works the way I always wanted it to.</description>

<p>With the release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTunes w/ podcasting support<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;ve begun again and I have to say this time I think it will stick. Having it update automatically in iTunes itself and with the iPod support it just works the way I always wanted it to. I did make one change and that is that I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Odeo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for my subscriptions. I find that it is much better organized that the iTunes Podcast Store. The ability to tag posts is one of the killer features. It also lets me easily queue single shows. I then subscribe to my queue in iTunes and away I go. They also have their own app if your not an iTunes fan. I recommend you give it a try. Still in beta but already a great service. Here&rsquo;s some of my subscriptions:</p>

      <title>Innovative XML Server - OpenSearch</title>

      <guid>https://ryaneby.com/2005/07/innovative-xml-server-opensearch/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on various ideas for using our Innovative XML server. I first began with creating html views of featured lists. Once I had the syntax down I created RSS 2.0 feeds for the lists. While I was doing this I came across a post over at open-ilsthat referred to OpenSearch. I had done a little with OpenSearchwhen it first came out but not since I started playing with the XML server.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on various ideas for using our Innovative XML server. I first began with creating html views of featured lists. Once I had the syntax down I created RSS 2.0 feeds for the lists. While I was doing this I came across a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post over at open-ils<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that referred to OpenSearch. I had done a little with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenSearch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when it first came out but not since I started playing with the XML server. BTW, I recommend reading the whole post over at open-ils. Lots of great thinking in it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the end product:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://a9.com/harry%20potter?a=sB0007WF86M">http://a9.com/harry%20potter?a=sB0007WF86M</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that right now I only have the title and availabilities. This is because it was a quick mock-up and I wanted to make things a bit quicker (why in a future post). You can really add any data from the XML output by modifying the XSL file for the description. I find this is really easy to read though I really should add the pub date and call number. A special note as well: certain resources didn&rsquo;t seem to have a call number (thesis I think) so I chose to link to the OPAC by bib number. This also is a time saver as it is returned in the basic XML result.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First you&rsquo;ll need something server-side that can transform xml. I prefer to use php5 as these things are really simple in it. What you&rsquo;ll do is take arguments on the URL and then create a xml server query using it. For example here is a sample OpenSearch URL:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->opensearch.php?q=harry%20potter&amp;p=1&amp;c=10<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This sets the query to be &ldquo;harry potter&rdquo;, the first page of results and 10 titles returned. The resulting xml server query would be:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->path.to.xmlopac/.$term.&quot;/0/0/&quot;.$page.&quot;/&quot;.$count.&quot;?avsrank=D&amp;noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD&amp;exclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD.VARFLDPRIMARYALTERNATEPAIR<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A quick runthrough of what I&rsquo;m doing. The $term is actually the query from the URL with a &ldquo;X&rdquo; put in front of it to signify that it is keyword. I could just put the X right in the url line but remember I&rsquo;m reusing this from my RSS work which actually allows you to choose what kind of search. Page and count are simlar except where I have page is actually the result number. I do some arithmetic behind the scenes so page 2 starts at result 11. I know this is confusing and opensearch supports passing result number but again with was something I reused from before.</p>
<p>Once you have the URL you will want to apply XSLT to it. Here&rsquo;s the full template to transform your XML result into OpenSearch:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->XSL File<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (you may need to view source as I don&rsquo;t have all my mimetypes set)</p>
<p>You then need to make your script return the resulting feed. In my case I just echo&rsquo;d the result. There&rsquo;s an additional file you need to create to describe your opensearch interface which is outlined at the OpenSearch site. My explanation is probably bad so here are the 3 files you need:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning as I go so feel free to offer suggestions on coding, but please don&rsquo;t mock.</p>

      <description>Since I already had some of our new books lists being converted to RSS, I went ahead and tried it out as a screensaver on my laptop which now has OSX Tiger. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot (crappy quality - looks much better on screen):

      <title>Why I paid more for the iPod</title>

      <description>I have quite a few friends with mp3 players. Some have Creative, some iPods, some others. The ones that have iPods bought them mostly after trying mine. Mine is an old one (Gen 2 i think) that was the first to have the touch wheel. I personally like this more than Gen 3 as the touch buttons don&amp;rsquo;t give as much feedback as my normal ones. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind a click-wheel though.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have quite a few friends with mp3 players. Some have Creative, some iPods, some others. The ones that have iPods bought them mostly after trying mine. Mine is an old one (Gen 2 i think) that was the first to have the touch wheel. I personally like this more than Gen 3 as the touch buttons don&rsquo;t give as much feedback as my normal ones. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a click-wheel though.</p>
<p>I occasionally have a friend that asks me why I bought the iPod when it costs more and doesn&rsquo;t have as many features as some of the others. This was before it was a fad as well. I can&rsquo;t say it much better than it&rsquo;s covered here:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/06/shuffling">http://daringfireball.net/2005/06/shuffling</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I tried many mp3 players before I bought the iPod and every single one left me wanting. The Creative interface sucks. You have to work to listen to music and there&rsquo;s some many options that it really is more time consuming then it&rsquo;s worth. The iPod has such a simple interface that I almost never have to look at the interface it self. The only time I look at it these days is to see what song is playing or if I can&rsquo;t remember what playlists are on it. I usually just use shuffle mode now.</p>
<p>I would love to have features, such as Ogg support, but when I try out the players that support them I just want to throw them away. I encouraged anyone in the market for a new player to try out the various players. I think you&rsquo;ll agree that the iPod&rsquo;s interface is worth the extra money and the less features. I just tried some of the new ones and if I get a new mp3 player I think it will be an iPod again.</p>
<p>The iPod is also the reason I have the iBook I&rsquo;m on right now. (I still use Linux on some other machines though I may switch if money ever allows.)</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a lot of Open Source software so I&amp;rsquo;m used to documentation that is lacking, but for a commercial product I have to say that the Innovative XML server has some of the worst I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to create an OpenSearch module and RSS output (more details soon). To do this I was forced to study the DTD to figure out how to get all the data I needed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of Open Source software so I&rsquo;m used to documentation that is lacking, but for a commercial product I have to say that the Innovative XML server has some of the worst I&rsquo;ve seen. I&rsquo;ve managed to create an OpenSearch module and RSS output (more details soon). To do this I was forced to study the DTD to figure out how to get all the data I needed. The documention did get me started as too some of the options but some of it was just plain wrong.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a tidbit others might find helpful. The documentation states that if you want to get the IIIRecord portion of a result (includes holdings and ISBN,etc.) then you need to enter the following in the URL string:</p>
<p>noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRecord</p>
<p>This is actually incorrect as the XML server is case sensitive. The actual code you need is:</p>
<p>noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD</p>
<p>I figured this one out through studying the DTD. There&rsquo;s some other things that caught me up. In order to use these options you need to make sure there is no trailing slash on the URL. For example:</p>
<p>path.to.xml.opac/tgenetics/0/0/1/1/?noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD</p>
<p>will not return anything, but the following will:</p>
<p>path.to.xml.opac/tgenetics/0/0/1/1?noexclude=WXROOT.Heading.Title.IIIRECORD</p>
<p>Notice that there is no slash after the last &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The documentation is vary scarce on examples relating to the urls.</p>
<p>Something for those working on similar things. More information on how to make RSS feeds, etc soon. I&rsquo;ll get into my problems with the schema as well.</p>

      <description>Moodle - A Free, Open Source Course Management System for Online LearningAn interesting course management system. Our University currently uses ANGEL,which I like as a student and staff much more than Blackboard. This software looks very similar in scope though it&amp;rsquo;s OSS. One of the many things I like about ANGEL, though not open source, is that we tend to have freedom to fix things ourselves. Moodle might be a definite plus for those small universities or organizations that want to offer online training.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a few comments that seemed to say that patrons need only ask a reference librarian if they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do research. I&amp;rsquo;ll save most of my responses to that for a future post. I do want to address the problem that some patrons do not know what services are available to them. Some may even presume that the library doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer them. I have had multiple amazed callers when I tell them they can do this or that. &amp;quot;I can request books from other libraries? For free!!!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;You mean I can access these resources from home?&amp;quot; Some of these may seem common sense, but for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t used to having such services it may not be. This is especially true for academic libraries that may have patrons from smaller towns where the library couldn&amp;rsquo;t offer such things. I still remember when my old library got it&amp;rsquo;s first computer. Online catalog? Forget it. I&amp;rsquo;m in my early twenties, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure patrons older than me might even have more extreme experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s been a few comments that seemed to say that patrons need only ask a reference librarian if they don&rsquo;t know how to do research. I&rsquo;ll save most of my responses to that for a future post. I do want to address the problem that some patrons do not know what services are available to them. Some may even presume that the library doesn&rsquo;t offer them. I have had multiple amazed callers when I tell them they can do this or that. &quot;I can request books from other libraries? For free!!!&quot; or &quot;You mean I can access these resources from home?&quot; Some of these may seem common sense, but for those who aren&rsquo;t used to having such services it may not be. This is especially true for academic libraries that may have patrons from smaller towns where the library couldn&rsquo;t offer such things. I still remember when my old library got it&rsquo;s first computer. Online catalog? Forget it. I&rsquo;m in my early twenties, so I&rsquo;m sure patrons older than me might even have more extreme experiences.</p>
<p>So how do you help these users find out about these resources and help curb frustration? One way is contingency design. This is the process of planning for when things go wrong. A great resource for this is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Defensive Design for the Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the great usability folks over at 37 signals. I also recommend looking at their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->37Better Projects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weblog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Take for example my library&rsquo;s catalog. A keyword search that returns no results will automatically be reran as a word search. This may sound confusing (at least to me) because a keyword search is actually a phrase search. This is a topic for another discussion/rant.</p>
<p>Why not go a step further and put a small blurb at the top of the results page that&rsquo;s dependent on the number of results, etc. Perhaps a &quot;Having trouble finding what you want? Free live help is only a click away.&quot; linking to your online reference help or contact information for your reference desk. Or perhaps a &quot;Too many results? Try limiting your search.&quot; with a link to the refine search page. I personally didn&rsquo;t notice the refine search button on my search page as it blended into the navigation. I usually ended up just adding more words and trial and error. This is also an ideal place for things such as interlibrary loan and similar services. My catalog has a link to InMich, which I&rsquo;m sure many people ignore, not knowing what it is. It might be more productive to put a more human text of &quot;You can request books we don&rsquo;t have through InMich&quot; or something similar. Yes, this does take up a bit more room compared to a simple button, but if worked into the layout correctly, it may add more benefits than drawbacks. The &quot;Did you mean&hellip;&quot; feature of Google adds some clutter, but for a typo prone person such as myself, it&rsquo;s a lifesaver. There have been times that I would have never noticed my error if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that feature.</p>
<p>Another question I get a lot is if my library holds books for patrons. As far as I know (I learn more each day) we do not, but we do offer a recall service for checked out books. Many patrons do not know of this service. This might be helped with a simple link if the status of the book is checked out going to a page explaining the service. The words &quot;Checked Out&quot; could even be what links to it.</p>
<p>All of this information can be found somewhere on the library website, of course. But where the help is needed is where the problem is most likely to occur. By giving the patrons the help when they need it, it&rsquo;s much more likely that they will be able to recover on their own or if not, find the help they need.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange that a student would start a blog dealing mostly with libraries when I&amp;rsquo;m not enrolled in a library degree program or a current librarian.

I also have a lot of hobbies, many of which are technology related.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may seem strange that a student would start a blog dealing mostly with libraries when I&rsquo;m not enrolled in a library degree program or a current librarian. The truth of the matter is that I&rsquo;m a perpetual student whose major changes like the wind direction and who just happens to work at a library. I also have a lot of hobbies, many of which are technology related.</p>
<p>In a former blog life I wrote about technology in education. I have plans on restoring the archives of that blog and may post some of my old thoughts here if they are still pertinent. Though my major has changed continually since then, my interests haven&rsquo;t. I like to work with technology and more specifically how people can (or do) use it.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see in this blog are my ideas of possible technology solutions, responses to other peoples' ideas and the occasional rant. Feel free to leave your comments as I&rsquo;m always interested in other peoples experiences and opinions. It&rsquo;s probably important to know where I&rsquo;m coming from though. During my stint as an education major, I worked with kids of various ages and a few teachers, all of which rarely had more than very basic technology skills. The children were often those with learning disabilities or what would be labeled by the school as a &quot;problem child&quot;. It may seem that I&rsquo;m dumbing things down sometimes perhaps too much. Feel free to call me on it, but in some cases I will have to say there is no excuse for something to be so complicated. &quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; is a saying that should be considered.</p>
<p>For those who think their users don&rsquo;t fall in this category, I reserve my doubts. I currently work as tech support for my library. This includes non-tech related questions as well and I assure you there are plenty of patrons at least at my library that have problems with the library that may be overlooked by librarians or others. I hope to share those insights as much as I can.</p>
<p>On a side note, I will often mock-up examples of what I&rsquo;m talking about in order to help illustrate my ideas, as I&rsquo;m sure my explanations would be helped by them. These are all quick hack-jobs and may not work by the time you see them. I&rsquo;m hosting this on one of my servers at home and my internet isn&rsquo;t the greatest. My development skills are also lacking in many areas. Also many of these examples will say MSU Libraries. This is mostly because that&rsquo;s where I work and it helps me learn more about my own library by specifically using their resources (linking to their catalog, etc.). This blog and these pages are not endorsed by or are official pages of the MSU libraries, though some of the staff there read this blog.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s a quick round-up. Feel free to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Though not strictly relating to libraries, I believe it deserves mention due to many people&amp;rsquo;s misconception about security. A recent example was the ranting and raving about how google desktop finds chat logs and web browsing histories, etc. Many people thought Google Desktop was a privacy problem or a security problem. Google Desktop SHOWS you the security problem. These things are on your computer whether Google tells you they are or not.</description>

Google Desktop SHOWS you the security problem. These things are on your computer whether Google tells you they are or not. Sure it makes it easier for others to find or abuse, but perhaps that is what is needed for software companies to think more about security. Schneier says it better than I can:</p>

<p>I recommend reading everything he posts. He is one of the best security writers I know of and his posts are often timely and informative. Even more so now that he has a blog. I&rsquo;ve been a long time reader of his Crypto-gram prior. On a side note I&rsquo;m pretty sure some browsers let you choose to disable caching of data from encrypted pages. This should be a default though.</p>

      <title>Google Scholar and The Fury Unleashed</title>
      <link>https://ryaneby.com/2004/11/google-scholar-and-the-fury-unleashed/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Google Scholar&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; was unveiled, followed by numerous blog posts about it. The majority of the ones I read were positive and loved the idea, outside of some library related ones. There seemed to be some worry that it destroyed the possibility for federated search at a library. Here is a summary of my opinions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Scholar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was unveiled, followed by numerous blog posts about it. The majority of the ones I read were positive and loved the idea, outside of some library related ones. There seemed to be some worry that it destroyed the possibility for federated search at a library. Here is a summary of my opinions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll begin with the statement that I like it. I wish something like this would have been around in the past when I was writing up some research papers. The killer feature in my mind is the ability to easily see who cites what. I can then easily find the abstracts (at least) and see which papers are relevant and that I should try to acquire. The ability to search the web for related items is also useful, as I may be able to find some background information that might make it easier for me to understand.</p>
<p>There are a few features I would like to see, however. My main beef is access to everything through an API. Being able to integrate this into a library site (without nasty hacks) would be a godsend. It&rsquo;d also be helpful if the DOI&rsquo;s were used more often, though with this being an early beta, I can see that improving over time. There&rsquo;s a couple usability problems, such as when I choose to look at what works cite a resource, it doesn&rsquo;t tell me what resource I was previously looking at. I have to hit the back button to see where I came from. It&rsquo;d be nice if it told me whether it was an abstract or not as well, but I realize that wouldn&rsquo;t be easy. Marking things that have a Creative Commons license would be nice though.</p>
<p>So what about the problems people are talking about. From what I can gather some fear for the viability of federated search. As a user of a library (I am not a Librarian) I can say, I hope federated search happens soon and it is built well. I personally hate using the online indexes that my library provides. As a user I think they are a pain to use, look terrible, and don&rsquo;t give the relevant results I want. I plan on using Google Scholar to find the article I need and then moving to the indexes and library catalog to find a copy of it. Before I would do web searches and try to find sites that sourced some information or the similar.</p>
<p>I think this is where it becomes apparent of the difference between the students and the professional researcher. The professional researcher probably won&rsquo;t use Google Scholar as much as a student. (Except maybe to see who cites them.) I think professional researchers are more likely to know the exact terms to search for, what journals/indexes are most relevant and even what other others are prominent. A student is more likely to be walking in blind and this is where the ease of use of Google comes in handy. There are many traps that a student could fall into using Google Scholar as their sole source of research information. There are plenty of students I think fall into the trap of using generic websites because they either don&rsquo;t know of the resources available to them or they just can&rsquo;t figure out how to use them.</p>
<p>If anything good comes from this I hope it gives libraries and academic institutions the motivation to educate their users how to judge the credibility of information and what resources are available to them. I&rsquo;ve worked as a student at my library and I still have no idea about what all is available to me. Some of this is due to difficulty finding the exact information I need on the site and also due to me not having a reason to use certain resources. I went ahead and mocked up an example of how a library could use an informational site to show how to use Google Scholar WITH library resources. I used the library I use as an example, so all links, etc. will go to them. A side note, I found a few resources I didn&rsquo;t know about while making it.</p>

      <title>Using iTunes in the Library</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;a post on Tame the Web&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; that discussed the possibility of using iTunes at a library to serve audio files to patrons. The benefits can be numerous, but some limitations have to be kept in mind. I&amp;rsquo;ll first discuss the possibilities of such a venture, then the quirks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I recently came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post on Tame the Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that discussed the possibility of using iTunes at a library to serve audio files to patrons. The benefits can be numerous, but some limitations have to be kept in mind. I&rsquo;ll first discuss the possibilities of such a venture, then the quirks.</p>
<p>The benefits for small libraries are probably minimal. The possibilities are the most promising for institutions that have a large audio archive and the ability to digitize the audio if need be. Any library can allow patrons to listen to music, but if the library has a audio archive it becomes a way of advertising the holdings of the institution.</p>
<p>An example of this would be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vincent Voice Library<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at Michigan State University. This archives consists of thousands of audio items. If a server was provided for that department to feature certain recordings, it may bring users that would have never thought of using the service. An example would be speeches by Civil Rights activists during Black History Month, speeches by Einstein during the recent anniversary of his work, and other special events. Music is also a definite option, especially during appreciation months, etc. An additional benefit is the seamless experience for patrons. All they have to do is plug into the network and load iTunes. They may even discover the resource on accident.</p>
<p>There are various things that have to be kept in mine if something like this was implemented. Firstly iTunes itself only allows 5 computers to connect to it with sharing (last time I checked). This is due to the limitations on sharing iTunes store material, but applies to sharing in general. A possible way around this might be to use a compliant server such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->daapd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;m not sure if the server has similar limitations as iTunes.</p>
<p>This limitation brings up the possible problem of copyright. While the music is streamed to the client and not downloaded and is limited to the subnet of the server, I could see this as being construed as a public performance. Being a library and being used as an educational reason, it might fall under fair use, but this is definitely something that would have to be looked into before implementing a system. Public domain material is always an option and this could be the perfect way to expose patrons to older, more obscure material they might not hear otherwise.</p>
<p>A few other problems exist. The protocol used to broadcast is limited to the same subnet as it will not make it past routers without some additional tinkering. More information on that can be found on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->daapd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site. Another problem is the use of iTunes on public PC&rsquo;s. In small libraries this may not pose a problem, but in larger institutions it may become a problem as users try to load their own mp3&rsquo;s or similar onto the system, or not realize why it&rsquo;s there. An alternative to that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppleRecords<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a open-source client that connects to the daapd server and allows the streaming of the material (and that&rsquo;s about it). Patrons with their own laptops with iTunes can just access it with what they have. Bandwidth is also an issue depending on usage.</p>
<p>As a quick wrap-up, the possibilities are interesting, but if such a project was undertaken, it would be important to plan it out as it is not as simple as loading songs onto iTunes and hitting share, unfortunately.</p>]]></content:encoded>
