In response to <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/11270/">Casey's post regarding URL addressable cells in spreadsheets</a>, I came across <a href="http://numbler.com/">numbler</a> today which appears to <a href="http://numbler.com/apidoc">have a rest api</a> (and xml) that supports PUT, Get and Delete for cells and ranges. Will be interesting to see what kind of things can be made with this.
