Wikipedia has been in the news lately and has popped up in a few threads on Web4Lib. <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> has a great comic as usual.

Penny Arcade is one of my favorite comics and I recommend it. Some of them do require some computer/gaming knowledge and the language may offend some but I almost always find them hilarious.
