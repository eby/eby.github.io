Another one I forgot to post about some time ago. There's a <a href="http://scruffynerf.wordpress.com/2006/07/05/opac-blog-posts-a-list/">compiled list of posts about OPAC's over at Life as I Know It</a>. If you doing research on next-gen or just want to see people's opinions then it might be worthwhile to peruse.
