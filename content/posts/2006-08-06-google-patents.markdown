Via digg, I found <a href="http://www.arnoldit.com/lists/google-patents.asp">this list of Google patents</a>. It's quite long but if you are working with digital libraries you may want to peruse as there seem to be quite a few related to Google Book Search and include things like interfaces, addressing schemes and access control. It's also a way to see what might be coming down the pipe.
