Apple has their itunes/ipod, Sony had their own custom ones that never took off and Microsoft had one they tried to spread but even they are moving to a similar system as Apple with their new Zune. It just tends to hurt everyone but the platform provider. It’s possible that a standard could come about but whether anyone would rush to support it is another thing. eBooks is an area where this problem is present and libraries should be happy to see some vendors trying to do it without DRMand hopefully support and promote the efforts.\n","wordCount":"380","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2006-08-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2006-08-13T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/libraries-thwarting-open-access/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ryan Eby","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ryaneby.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
