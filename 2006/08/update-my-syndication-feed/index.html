I found the many RSS formats were fairly ambiguous. Usually it was much less so with the Atom spec. Due to this I have decided that the format I will support is Atom 1.0. I have modified Wordpress’s feed to provide valid Atom, which supposed is slated for a future Wordpress release. My feed provides both excerpts and full text. If you use an aggregator such as Bloglines you should be able to display either. I’m uncertain about other aggregator support but Atom support seems to be getting better and better.\nThis, of course, was my choice based on my experience. You may choose to support something else. If you notice anything weird with my feed, please let me know in the comments. The comment feed is still RSS 2.0 and I’ll likely change that in the future as well.\nRemember to validate your feed. Now I just need to do something about the website itself.\n","wordCount":"496","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2006-08-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2006-08-04T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ryaneby.com/2006/08/update-my-syndication-feed/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ryan Eby","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ryaneby.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
