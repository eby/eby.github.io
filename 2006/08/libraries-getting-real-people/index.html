This is usually where a reference librarian would come into play, but if the question is common it may also be a place for other outreach. Maybe it would be a good idea to prepare an “evaluating resources” handout for professors to give to students (including reference contacts), that breaks down the various sources they should use and how to find them at your library. Or maybe it’s a sign that things should be reworded or a link to a guide should be made more visable. If your main audience is students, then common tasks and research guides should likely be moved to the forefront.
