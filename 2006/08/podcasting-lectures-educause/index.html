One of the first findings was that most students seemed to prefer audio over video, which they attribute to being more portable. This is despite the students actually originally requesting video, which shows that it&rsquo;s worthwhile doing more indepth studies like this. This was a good thing, as moving to audio only provided a large reduction in staff time.">
