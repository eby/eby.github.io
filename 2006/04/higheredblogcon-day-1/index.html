<title>HigherEdBlogCon - Day 1 | Ryan Eby</title>
<meta name=keywords content>
<meta name=description content="If you hadn&rsquo;t kept track the HigherEdBlogCon started today. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on writing up any notes since it&rsquo;s an online conference where anyone can watch/participate, but since it matches my interests I should at least comment on the ideas. I need to post more often anyways.
There were two presentations today with the topic of podcasting and screencasting. With such a hot topic I was rather disappointed to see only two presentations.">
