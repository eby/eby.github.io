<div class=post-content><p>Had an issue with IE upgrades in the recent past where after the upgrade multiple pre-existing profiles would state they were in &ldquo;Enhanced Security Mode&rdquo; despite that mode being disabled. New profiles would work fine and Administrator usually did as well.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve been able to track down, MS hasn&rsquo;t figured out the exact circumstances that cause it. Fresh installs w/ upgrades before anyone logs in seem to work fine in my experience. Some profiles would also work fine despite being similar to ones that did.</p>
<p>Searches brought up multiple hacks to fix it. One is to make a login script that modifies the registry like so for every user:</p>
<pre><code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
&quot;IEHardenIENoWarn&quot;=dword:00000000

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap]
&quot;IEHarden&quot;=dword:00000000
</code></pre>
<p>The best solution I found, though, was to use GPO and force a setting for the Internet Zone. Forcing it to Medium or whatever level appears to get pass the enhanced security issues and things work like normal.</p>
<p>Under either User or Computer depending on how you have GPO setup you would want to enable and set a level for:</p>
<pre><code>Administrative Templates&gt;Windows Components&gt;Internet Explorer&gt;Internet Control Panel&gt;Security Page&gt;Internet Zone
</code></pre>
<p>Not ideal but it is the best I&rsquo;ve found</p>
